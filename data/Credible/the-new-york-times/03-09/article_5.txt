Now, in the wake of those and other questions from The Times, the university has decided to take a new look to determine whether it handled those cases properly. \u201cThe university is instituting an independent external review,\u201d a spokesman, Christopher Davey, said in a statement, adding that the review \u201cis not an indication that we have discovered any evidence of scientific misconduct or other issues raised in your inquiry.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-6\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-6 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-7\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"415\" data-total-count=\"4164\" id=\"story-continues-7\">Whatever the outcome of that review, Mr. Davey said, decisions on research misconduct at Ohio State were based solely on \u201cthe facts and the merits of each individual case,\u201d not a researcher\u2019s grant money. Any other suggestion would be \u201cfalse and offensive,\u201d he said, adding that the university has \u201cspent significantly more to support his research program than he has brought in from outside sources.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"487\" data-total-count=\"4651\">During an interview in October, and in a later statement, Dr. Croce, 72, denied any wrongdoing, said he had been singled out in some of the accusations simply because he was a prominent figure, and largely placed the blame for any problems with figures or text on junior researchers or collaborators at other labs. Academic papers often have multiple authors, with the scientists who perform the hands-on work listed at the beginning and the senior scientists in charge named at the end.</p><div id=\"story-ad-2\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-8\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-8\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"359\" data-total-count=\"5010\" id=\"story-continues-8\">\u201cIt is true that errors sometimes occur in the preparation of figures for publication,\u201d Dr. Croce said in the statement, issued through the Columbus law firm Kegler Brown Hill &amp; Ritter. Any mistakes with figures were \u201chonest errors,\u201d he said, adding that he did not condone plagiarism but that he must rely on co-authors to provide proper attribution.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"479\" data-total-count=\"5489\">Even before his arrival at Ohio State in 2004, Dr. Croce had stepped beyond the generally expected bounds of cancer research. In 1994, he joined the scientific advisory board of the Council for Tobacco Research, which the tobacco companies created to fight the public perception \u2014 supported by increasingly overwhelming scientific evidence \u2014 that smoking caused cancer. Dr. Croce said in the interview and the statement that he had always believed that smoking caused cancer.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-10\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-10 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-9\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"585\" data-total-count=\"6074\" id=\"story-continues-9\">During the same period, Dr. Croce and a colleague faced federal allegations that they had submitted false claims for payment of grant money for science that was never carried out and that was to be overseen by a scientist who had, in fact, left the United States and gone to Italy. After the case was combined with a second fraud investigation, a civil settlement forced Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, where Dr. Croce worked at the time, to pay $2.6 million to the government. Neither Dr. Croce nor the other parties to the settlement admitted any wrongdoing in the case.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"218\" data-total-count=\"6292\">In a world where most scientists are so wary of public conflict that they seem to apportion criticism with a pipette, the new doubts about Dr. Croce\u2019s work draw carefully measured opinions from some towering figures.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-12\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-6 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-10\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"538\" data-total-count=\"6830\" id=\"story-continues-10\">Randy Schekman, a <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/nobel_prizes/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"More articles about Nobel Prizes.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">Nobel Prize</a>-winning biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, said he had informally advised Dr. Sanders in 2015 on lodging a complaint about Dr. Croce\u2019s work with the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which he once edited and which has been the most common venue for Dr. Croce\u2019s work, according to the PubMed database. \u201cI am aware of the allegations, and I am aware of other concerns that have been raised about Croce\u2019s work outside of these specific allegations,\u201d Dr. Schekman said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"196\" data-total-count=\"7026\">Another Nobel Prize-winning biologist, Phillip Sharp of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who said he had been previously unaware of the misconduct allegations, offered qualified support.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"378\" data-total-count=\"7404\">\u201cI would say Carlo has made some important contributions to the molecular causes of cancer,\u201d Dr. Sharp said. \u201cI can\u2019t condone the sloppiness he has in general.

A federal court later found that the council was central to a conspiracy to deceive the public on the dangers of smoking. Dr. Croce stayed on until the council was disbanded in the industry\u2019s more than $100 billion settlement with tobacco plaintiffs in 1998.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"204\" data-total-count=\"9015\">During the interview, Dr. Croce said he believed that smoking was the primary cause of lung cancer; that belief, he said in his later statement, dated from \u201clong before\u201d he joined the tobacco council.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-20\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-10 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-15\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"146\" data-total-count=\"9161\" id=\"story-continues-15\">Still, some of the research Dr. Croce pioneered in those years was used by the tobacco industry to fight the assertion that smoking caused cancer.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"389\" data-total-count=\"9550\">In 1996, Dr. Croce and co-workers made international news with their discovery of a gene called the fragile histidine triad \u2014 FHIT for short. His claims for its importance could hardly have been more sweeping: Damage to the gene, Dr. Croce told The Associated Press, was probably \u201cthe starting point of the most common human malignancies, including lung, esophagus and colon cancer.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"406\" data-total-count=\"9956\">Dr. Croce was careful to point out in his scientific papers that carcinogens in cigarette smoke could in fact be the agents that damaged the FHIT gene, and there is no evidence that he publicly defended the tobacco industry. \u201cNone of the work reflected in these papers suggested, stated or implied that cancer was caused by an inherited genetic condition,\u201d Dr. Croce said in his statement to The Times.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"464\" data-total-count=\"10420\">But for the industry, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered, said William Farone, once a scientist for the tobacco industry who has repeatedly testified against it. \u201cHe knows damn well what use of the genetic information there would be to someone in the tobacco industry,\u201d Dr. Farone said.

He has looked beyond the small fraction of human DNA that actually encodes for proteins \u2014 less than 2 percent \u2014 to the rest of the DNA, once all but ignored as contributing little to the workings of a cell.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-28\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-17\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"242\" data-total-count=\"11679\" id=\"story-continues-17\">Scientists came to realize that this DNA could make short molecules that influence how genes, and therefore living cells, operate.

First, the university was obliged to open what it called a \u201creview of potential research misconduct,\u201d in this case involving potential plagiarism in a federal grant proposal. Second, the university cleared him, largely because the junior colleague provided a somewhat circuitous explanation. The two had worked together on a previous project, the colleague said, and Dr. Croce appeared to have reused some of that material. As a result, Caroline C. Whitacre, then the university\u2019s vice dean for research, concluded, \u201cThe incident does not indicate possible misconduct as defined by the university\u2019s policy.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"91\" data-total-count=\"13722\">Over the next several years, there were other allegations, investigations and closed cases.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"218\" data-total-count=\"13940\">A tipster alleged that over several years, an official at the Croce lab used Dr. Croce\u2019s grant money for personal trips abroad and improperly pressured lab members to include the official\u2019s name on research papers.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"215\" data-total-count=\"14155\">In another series of allegations and subsequent appeals, a former research colleague accused Dr. Croce of scientific misconduct involving, among other things, using the researcher\u2019s work without credit on patents.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-36\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-6 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-20\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"78\" data-total-count=\"14233\" id=\"story-continues-20\">Dr. Croce was cleared in both of those cases.

The office labors under an awkward constraint: It does not carry out its own investigations, but relies on accused researchers\u2019 own institutions to forward their findings.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-42\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-6 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-22\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"304\" data-total-count=\"16840\" id=\"story-continues-22\">With their own reputations on the line, institutions \u201chave a tremendous conflict of interest,\u201d said Dr. Richard Smith, former editor of The British Medical Journal and a founding member of the <a href=\"http://publicationethics.org/resources\">Committee on Publication Ethics</a> in Britain. \u201cThere\u2019s a terrible temptation to bury it all,\u201d he added.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"289\" data-total-count=\"17129\">There are also dollars at stake. Of the $29.1 million Dr. Croce has received in federal funding as a principal investigator while at Ohio State, university records show, $8.7 million has gone directly to the university in overhead payments, a fairly standard cut for research institutions.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-44\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-23\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"424\" data-total-count=\"17553\" id=\"story-continues-23\">In an unrelated case at Ohio State, similar conflicts seemed to surface in 2011 after a whistle-blower accused a pharmacy researcher, Terry Elton, of fabricating data. The university cleared Dr. Elton after a brief inquiry, but the integrity office played the one powerful card it holds: refusing to accept what it considers flawed or shoddy investigations. Ohio State <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2013/01/06/probe-by-osu-missed-fraud.html\">redid the investigation</a> and Dr. Elton was found guilty.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"196\" data-total-count=\"17749\">The initial inquiry was compromised by relying on Dr. Elton\u2019s own assurances, Dr. Dahlberg said, adding, \u201cWhen somebody is accused of being dishonest, why do you believe everything he says?\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"182\" data-total-count=\"17931\">As with the Elton case, and the university\u2019s earlier handling of complaints against Dr. Croce, documents suggest little appetite for taking the Clare Francis allegations seriously.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"427\" data-total-count=\"18358\">In May 2013, the university\u2019s research integrity officer \u2014 ostensibly an impartial observer \u2014 wrote to Dr. Dahlberg largely to pass along disparaging information on Clare Francis, including the irritation that his or her persistence had caused for some journal editors. The officer, Jennifer Yucel, who had been involved in the initial inquiry into Dr. Elton, said the information had come from \u201cCarlo\u201d \u2014 Dr. Croce.</p><div id=\"story-ad-7\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-6 ad-aggro-8\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-24\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"266\" data-total-count=\"18624\" id=\"story-continues-24\">Among the attachments was an earlier note from Dr. Croce to the editor of a British journal who had received complaints from Clare Francis. \u201cClearly we are dealing with a mentally deranged person who should be recovered in a mental institution,\u201d Dr. Croce wrote.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"374\" data-total-count=\"18998\">With that preamble, what Ohio State called a \u201cpreliminary assessment\u201d of possible misconduct went ahead. Two younger scientists working with Dr. Croce admitted that they had improperly duplicated, mishandled and mislabeled a number of western blot figures and other data in the papers, emails obtained by The Times show.

But instead of telling them what to look for, he simply flashes a series of western blots onto a screen and asks the students if they see anything amiss.</p><div id=\"story-ad-8\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent \">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-30\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"403\" data-total-count=\"22206\" id=\"story-continues-30\"><a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/102/43/15611.full\">The paper</a>, published in 2005 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is on something called the WWOX gene, thought to be a tumor suppressor. Dr. Sanders said the students invariably noticed that lanes 6, 7 and 8 in one row of blots had apparently been duplicated into the immediately adjacent lanes \u2014 3, 4, and 5 \u2014 which are supposed to have come from different experimental samples.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"304\" data-total-count=\"22510\">\u201cThis is the one I start with because it\u2019s so obvious,\u201d Dr. Sanders said. \u201cThere\u2019s uncomfortable laughter. They say, \u2018Why would these people get away with that?\u2019\u201d When he adds that the journal declined to take action, he said, \u201cThey\u2019re very stunned that that sort of thing happens.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"306\" data-total-count=\"22816\">In response to questions from The Times, the journal said that two \u201csubject experts\u201d it consulted after Dr. Sanders challenged the paper in 2014 \u201cdisagreed on whether the images were duplicates.\u201d Therefore, the journal said, editors \u201ccould not conclusively determine\u201d whether to issue a notice.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-60\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-6 ad-aggro-10 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-31\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"312\" data-total-count=\"23128\" id=\"story-continues-31\">Dr. Sanders, 56, studies how modified versions of viruses, like Ebola, could be used to treat disease.

He lost.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"265\" data-total-count=\"23393\">After receiving several tips on Dr. Croce\u2019s work, Dr. Sanders said, he decided to undertake yet another moonlighting effort: as a \u201cfreelance ethicist.\u201d \u201cA lab that is engaging in violating scientific norms is being rewarded for that very effort,\u201d he said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"396\" data-total-count=\"23789\">Dr. Croce said in his statement that until he was contacted for this article, he had not been aware of Dr. Sanders \u201cor of his role in sending allegations to journals.\u201d As for the WWOX paper, Dr. Croce\u2019s response appears to have varied. Diane Sullenberger, executive editor of the Proceedings, said the journal had contacted Dr. Croce over the allegations of image manipulation in the paper.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"49\" data-total-count=\"23838\">\u201cDr. Croce disagrees,\u201d Ms. Sullenberger said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"260\" data-total-count=\"24098\">But in his statement to The Times, Dr. Croce responded differently. \u201cIt is possible, but not certain, that an error was made,\u201d he said, adding that if there was an error, \u201cit affects nothing,\u201d because the results were confirmed in separate experiments.</p><div id=\"story-ad-9\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-8\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-32\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"180\" data-total-count=\"24278\" id=\"story-continues-32\">The Times showed the paper to four experts in the forensic analysis of images in research papers, and all agreed that the blots had almost certainly been duplicated by the authors.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"377\" data-total-count=\"24655\">\u201cMaybe they would have an explanation for this, but I can\u2019t think of one,\u201d said James O\u2019Brien, a <a href=\"http://obrien.berkeley.edu\">professor of computer science</a> at the University of California, Berkeley. He said that while the evidence of duplication was overwhelming, he could not say for certain whether the operation was deliberate.

In at least half of those instances, the scientists found signs of deliberate manipulation.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-68\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-34\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"260\" data-total-count=\"25606\" id=\"story-continues-34\">The Times provided an author of that study, Elisabeth Bik, then at Stanford, with a list of published corrections involving the blots in Dr. Croce\u2019s papers. \u201cYes, the image problems in most of these are very similar to the ones we encountered,\u201d she said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"361\" data-total-count=\"25967\">Because the study focused on a tiny slice of the literature that allowed researchers to see immediate problems \u2014 duplications of western blots \u2014 the potential implications are distressing, said another author, Dr. Arturo Casadevall, chairman of the department of molecular microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s school of public health.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-70\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-10 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-35\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"175\" data-total-count=\"26142\" id=\"story-continues-35\">\u201cScience is built on science,\u201d Dr. Casadevall said. \u201cNothing new stands alone.\u201d Incorrect or fraudulent papers, he said, \u201ccould be slowing the pace of everything.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"422\" data-total-count=\"26564\">Dr. Bik vouched for the difficulty of pushing journals to act on evidence of bad data. As of October, this was her box score after contacting journals about all of the papers with problematic images: 32 retractions; 111 corrections; 52 notices that the journals had decided to take no action; and nearly 600 cases with no reply, basic acknowledgment of the message or general statement that the journal would look into it.</p><div id=\"story-ad-10\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-6 ad-aggro-8\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-36\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"210\" data-total-count=\"26774\" id=\"story-continues-36\">Another author of the study, Dr. Ferric Fang, a microbiology professor and journal editor at the University of Washington, said improper images began turning up in the 1990s.

Wearing an untucked pink polo shirt and jeans, he expounded on his career last fall in the interview in his corner office, where a computer screen rose above mounds of papers blanketing a conference table.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe said that he traveled professionally more often than he was on campus, in part because he disdained what he called the lack of culture in Columbus. Born and educated in Italy, he is noted for his private collection of Italian Renaissance and Baroque paintings \u2014 a testament to having an uncanny eye for spotting works by genuine masters and buying them for a fraction of their true worth, as Smithsonian magazine wrote in 2009. The hometown passion for Buckeye football leaves him cold. He also has little patience for scientific colleagues who are unwilling to part with accepted wisdom.\n\n\u201cScientists are like cows,\u201d he said. \u201cThey like to follow something which has already been established.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Croce, who has a medical degree but no Ph.D., showed his own willingness to buck scientific consensus when he became an adviser to the Council for Tobacco Research. A federal court later found that the council was central to a conspiracy to deceive the public on the dangers of smoking. Dr. Croce stayed on until the council was disbanded in the industry\u2019s more than $100 billion settlement with tobacco plaintiffs in 1998.\n\nDuring the interview, Dr. Croce said he believed that smoking was the primary cause of lung cancer; that belief, he said in his later statement, dated from \u201clong before\u201d he joined the tobacco council.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, some of the research Dr. Croce pioneered in those years was used by the tobacco industry to fight the assertion that smoking caused cancer.\n\nIn 1996, Dr. Croce and co-workers made international news with their discovery of a gene called the fragile histidine triad \u2014 FHIT for short. His claims for its importance could hardly have been more sweeping: Damage to the gene, Dr. Croce told The Associated Press, was probably \u201cthe starting point of the most common human malignancies, including lung, esophagus and colon cancer.\u201d\n\nDr. Croce was careful to point out in his scientific papers that carcinogens in cigarette smoke could in fact be the agents that damaged the FHIT gene, and there is no evidence that he publicly defended the tobacco industry. \u201cNone of the work reflected in these papers suggested, stated or implied that cancer was caused by an inherited genetic condition,\u201d Dr. Croce said in his statement to The Times.\n\nBut for the industry, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered, said William Farone, once a scientist for the tobacco industry who has repeatedly testified against it. \u201cHe knows damn well what use of the genetic information there would be to someone in the tobacco industry,\u201d Dr. Farone said. And the litigation archive shows that the scientific advisory board and Dr. Croce\u2019s name were repeatedly invoked to give credibility to the tobacco companies\u2019 expert witnesses.\n\nDr. Croce said he had been unaware at the time that his name was used to lend credibility to any assertion that smoking did not cause cancer or that the causality had not been proved. Any such use of his name, his statement said, \u201cwas false and fraudulent.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmong Dr. Croce\u2019s peers, there was skepticism of Dr. Croce\u2019s broad claims for the FHIT gene, and today some scientists say it seems more a marker of malignancy than the \u201cRosetta Stone\u201d of cancer research, as some news reports called it at the time.\n\nDuring the interview, Dr. Croce continued to promote the FHIT research but conceded that \u201cit\u2019s not fashionable anymore.\u201d\n\nDr. Croce, chairman of the department of cancer biology and genetics at Ohio State, has since moved on to one of the hottest areas of genomics and cancer research. He has looked beyond the small fraction of human DNA that actually encodes for proteins \u2014 less than 2 percent \u2014 to the rest of the DNA, once all but ignored as contributing little to the workings of a cell.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nScientists came to realize that this DNA could make short molecules that influence how genes, and therefore living cells, operate. If genes are the notes on a keyboard, those molecules act as volume controls \u2014 regulators of gene expression.\n\nSome of those short molecules are called microRNAs. Dr. Croce\u2019s work has linked various cancers to a deficiency or overabundance of certain microRNAs. Those effects, he asserted in a 2009 article, contribute to \u201cmost, if not all, human malignancies.\u201d MicroRNAs, he posited, could lead to entirely new cancer therapies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOnce again, the scope of Dr. Croce\u2019s claims has left colleagues wary. While few researchers dispute the role of microRNA as a cancer marker, there is skepticism that the case has been made for its therapeutic potential.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find scientists who say it\u2019s hype,\u201d said Graham Brock, a cancer researcher who has studied the molecules. While Dr. Croce is not the only scientist who may be overselling the findings, he added, \u201che\u2019s probably the strongest advocate.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAllegations Made, and Cases Closed\n\nThe email, sent on Nov. 1, 2007, came from an official at the National Institutes of Health, the federal grant-giving agency, and it could not have been more straightforward: Major sections of a grant proposal by Dr. Croce were essentially identical to one submitted four months earlier by a junior colleague at Ohio State.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe will be withdrawing the second application,\u201d the official wrote.\n\nAt that point, documents show, two things happened that would become familiar in Dr. Croce\u2019s record. First, the university was obliged to open what it called a \u201creview of potential research misconduct,\u201d in this case involving potential plagiarism in a federal grant proposal. Second, the university cleared him, largely because the junior colleague provided a somewhat circuitous explanation. The two had worked together on a previous project, the colleague said, and Dr. Croce appeared to have reused some of that material. As a result, Caroline C. Whitacre, then the university\u2019s vice dean for research, concluded, \u201cThe incident does not indicate possible misconduct as defined by the university\u2019s policy.\u201d\n\nOver the next several years, there were other allegations, investigations and closed cases.\n\nA tipster alleged that over several years, an official at the Croce lab used Dr. Croce\u2019s grant money for personal trips abroad and improperly pressured lab members to include the official\u2019s name on research papers.\n\nIn another series of allegations and subsequent appeals, a former research colleague accused Dr. Croce of scientific misconduct involving, among other things, using the researcher\u2019s work without credit on patents.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Croce was cleared in both of those cases. But that was just the beginning.\n\nBy 2013, officials at Ohio State and the federal Office of Research Integrity were receiving allegations that more than 30 papers on which Dr. Croce was an author contained improperly manipulated western blots and other data, according to official university correspondence.\n\nThe new allegations came from a pseudonymous source both legendary and loathed in biomedical circles: a scientific gadfly known as Clare Francis. Whoever Clare Francis actually is, he or she has an uncanny knack for seeing improperly altered images, as well as smaller flaws that some editors are inclined to ignore.\n\nClare Francis has a particular, high-strung style. \u201cYou misunderstand that Carlo Croce is a great scientist,\u201d Clare Francis wrote in a note copied to John Dahlberg, then the deputy director at the research integrity office. \u201cMy reply was that he has over a thousand papers. That is not the same thing. You simply misunderstand science. Please stop talking about reputations and look at the reality!\u201d\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nMindful of the hurdles that an investigation would face at Ohio State, as well as federal constraints like a six-year statute of limitations, Dr. Dahlberg trimmed Clare Francis\u2019 initial list of allegations to the two he considered the most actionable. One paper was on the FHIT gene, another on microRNA research.\n\nEven then, Dr. Dahlberg knew that any investigation by Ohio State of what he called \u201ca rainmaker\u201d for the university would face serious obstacles. With the number of more junior researchers involved in the work, Dr. Dahlberg was also skeptical that Dr. Croce\u2019s knowledge of any falsifications could be obtained in a straightforward way \u2014 for example, from data and records on his own computer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMy sense was, Carlo Croce\u2019s too big to make findings of misconduct on,\u201d Dr. Dahlberg said in an interview. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u2018A Tremendous Conflict of Interest\u2019\n\nWithin the realm of biomedical science, it falls to the Office of Research Integrity to issue formal findings of scientific misconduct, which can lead to suspension of federal financing and effectively end a research career. The office labors under an awkward constraint: It does not carry out its own investigations, but relies on accused researchers\u2019 own institutions to forward their findings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith their own reputations on the line, institutions \u201chave a tremendous conflict of interest,\u201d said Dr. Richard Smith, former editor of The British Medical Journal and a founding member of the Committee on Publication Ethics in Britain. \u201cThere\u2019s a terrible temptation to bury it all,\u201d he added.\n\nThere are also dollars at stake. Of the $29.1 million Dr. Croce has received in federal funding as a principal investigator while at Ohio State, university records show, $8.7 million has gone directly to the university in overhead payments, a fairly standard cut for research institutions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn an unrelated case at Ohio State, similar conflicts seemed to surface in 2011 after a whistle-blower accused a pharmacy researcher, Terry Elton, of fabricating data. The university cleared Dr. Elton after a brief inquiry, but the integrity office played the one powerful card it holds: refusing to accept what it considers flawed or shoddy investigations. Ohio State redid the investigation and Dr. Elton was found guilty.\n\nThe initial inquiry was compromised by relying on Dr. Elton\u2019s own assurances, Dr. Dahlberg said, adding, \u201cWhen somebody is accused of being dishonest, why do you believe everything he says?\u201d\n\nAs with the Elton case, and the university\u2019s earlier handling of complaints against Dr. Croce, documents suggest little appetite for taking the Clare Francis allegations seriously.\n\nIn May 2013, the university\u2019s research integrity officer \u2014 ostensibly an impartial observer \u2014 wrote to Dr. Dahlberg largely to pass along disparaging information on Clare Francis, including the irritation that his or her persistence had caused for some journal editors. The officer, Jennifer Yucel, who had been involved in the initial inquiry into Dr. Elton, said the information had come from \u201cCarlo\u201d \u2014 Dr. Croce.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmong the attachments was an earlier note from Dr. Croce to the editor of a British journal who had received complaints from Clare Francis. \u201cClearly we are dealing with a mentally deranged person who should be recovered in a mental institution,\u201d Dr. Croce wrote.\n\nWith that preamble, what Ohio State called a \u201cpreliminary assessment\u201d of possible misconduct went ahead. Two younger scientists working with Dr. Croce admitted that they had improperly duplicated, mishandled and mislabeled a number of western blot figures and other data in the papers, emails obtained by The Times show. The scientists called the problems unintentional.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOhio State took the scientists at their word. But in a July 2013 document marked \u201cconfidential and sensitive,\u201d the university told Dr. Croce to generate a plan detailing how he would \u201caddress the systemic deficiencies in data collection, handling and retention identified in this case.\u201d In addition, he was to assist his junior colleagues \u201cin correcting or retracting the two papers.\u201d\n\nIn the statement issued through his lawyers, Dr. Croce said he and a colleague \u201cprepared and carried out a written action plan.\u201d But the university apparently never ensured that its demands were met.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor example, no correction for the FHIT paper appeared until last November, after The Times contacted the journal, Clinical Cancer Research. A spokeswoman for the journal said that a reader, not the authors, initiated the correction, which had been delayed because of \u201can administrative oversight.\u201d Dr. Croce\u2019s statement said it was \u201cDr. Croce\u2019s understanding\u201d that a junior scientist had \u201cprovided all the pertinent information to the journal back at the time the issue was raised.\u201d\n\nThere was a final twist: Ohio State referred to its findings as an \u201calternative resolution\u201d under the university\u2019s policy \u2014 meaning no formal finding of fraud or scientific misconduct. In fact, Ohio State decided not to convene a formal investigation committee, in part because \u201cthere is very little data for the committee to review\u201d \u2014 a reference to the failure of the scientists to locate almost any of their original data. Those decisions allowed the case to remain largely confidential. The integrity office accepted the result.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPublicly, Dr. Whitacre, who had since become vice president for research, gave no ground. Little action had been required as a result of the allegations, Dr. Whitacre wrote to Clare Francis after the whistle-blower sent additional allegations in December 2013. \u201cPlease note,\u201d Dr. Whitacre wrote, \u201cthat the Institution considers continued activities in this vein as constituting frivolous allegations and a waste of university and state resources.\u201d\n\nIn response to questions from The Times, Ohio State issued a statement on behalf of Dr. Whitacre and Dr. Yucel, saying they \u201cbelieve they followed all policies and procedures in their roles in responding to the matters involving Dr. Carlo Croce based on the facts that were available at the time.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/09/us/09cancerfraud-2/xxcancerfraud-2-blog427.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/17/us/xxcancerfraud-1/xxcancerfraud-1-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/17/us/xxcancerfraud-1/xxcancerfraud-1-articleLarge-v4.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2017/02/13/croce/df4141bc255c558ac15971e2740c92e03d7d4788/wwox-clip.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2017/02/13/croce/df4141bc255c558ac15971e2740c92e03d7d4788/wwox-only.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/08/us/09cancerfraud-3/xxcancerfraud-3-superJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/16/us/xxcancerfraud-5/xxcancerfraud-5-master675.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/08/us/09cancerfraud-4/xxcancerfraud-4-superJumbo.jpg"], "videos": []}
