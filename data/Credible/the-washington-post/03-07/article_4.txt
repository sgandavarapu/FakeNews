(The Ways and Means draft is <a href=\"https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AmericanHealthCareAct_WM.pdf\">here</a>. The Energy and Commerce draft is <a href=\"http://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/republicans.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/AmericanHealthCareAct.pdf\">here</a>.)</p> <p>The proposals let people stay on their parents\u2019 plans until they turn 26 and forbid insurers from denying coverage or charging more to people with preexisting conditions. There would be no more individual mandate, but to prod people to pay for coverage insurers would be given permission to impose a surcharge of 30 percent on customers who have a gap between plans.</p> <p><strong>-- But here\u2019s the rub: We don\u2019t know how many people will lose coverage or how much this might blow up the deficit over time. What was released last night has not been scored by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.</strong> <strong>This is a big deal because both House committees with jurisdiction plan to take up the legislation tomorrow and advance the overhaul without this kind of formal analysis.</strong></p> <p>House GOP leadership created a \u201c<a href=\"https://housegop.leadpages.co/healthcare/\">frequently asked questions</a>\u201d web site to accompany the draft legislation. One question is, \u201cHow are you paying for this plan? How much is it going to cost taxpayers?\u201d This is the answer in full: \u201c<strong>We are still discussing details</strong>, but we are committed to repealing Obamacare and replacing it with fiscally responsible policies that restore the free market and protect taxpayers.\u201d</p> <p><strong>-- What we do know from the drafts is that there are huge tax breaks for some of the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/obamacare-tax-cut-repeal-235752\">richest Americans</a>: </strong></p> <p><strong>\u201cHouseholds at the top of the U.S. income ladder would see taxes on their wages and investments drop under the House Republicans\u2019 new health-care proposal,\u201d </strong><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-earners-would-pay-less-tax-under-gop-health-care-proposal-1488882602\">the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Richard Rubin notes.</a> \u201cAs expected, the bill repeals a 3.8% tax on investment income and a 0.9% tax on wages. Both levies affect only the highest-earning households, those individuals making at least $200,000 and married couples making more than $250,000.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u201cThe Republican plan (also) includes a tax break for insurance company executives making over $500,000 per year,\u201d</strong> &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/paulmcleod/the-republican-healthcare-plan-includes-tax-break-for-insura\">BuzzFeed\u2019s Paul McLeod observes</a>. \u201cCompanies can generally deduct employee salaries as a business expense but in 2013 the ACA capped the deductions on health insurance executive salaries at $500,000. The average compensation for top health insurance executives is in the millions. In 2014 the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies found that <strong>this cap generated $72 million in additional tax revenue</strong>.\u201d The draft explicitly eliminates the cap, so the more insurance companies pay their executives the less they will pay in taxes.</p> <p><strong>-- Policy experts bemoan the lack of a CBO score. </strong></p> <p>From a health economist who <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/afrakt\">teaches at Boston University</a> and does work for the Department of Veterans Affairs:<strong> </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What do we want?

But the drafts propose refundable tax credits that would hinge on earnings as well as age \u2014 providing bigger credits for older and poorer Americans.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Why conservatives didn\u2019t want to take income into account: </strong>It requires getting the IRS involved to verify assets, which means more government employees are involved.</p> <p><strong>So why the change?</strong> The income-based phase-out of the credit allows the GOP plan to be funded without taxes on employer-provided insurance that had been considered earlier in the drafting process.</p> <p><strong>-- Medicaid costs will be pushed toward the states over time. </strong>The Medicaid expansion would stop in 2020, for all intents and purposes. The program would set a per capita cap on funding to states, depending on how many people are enrolled. This could potentially be a problem in the Senate, where four Republicans yesterday promised to oppose any bill that would hurt expansion states. \u201cWe will not support a plan that does not include stability for Medicaid expansion populations or flexibility for states,\u201d Rob Portman (Ohio), Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), Cory Gardner (Colo.) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) wrote.</p> <p><strong>-- Planned Parenthood gets defunded. </strong>The bill makes the women\u2019s health organization, which receives about $500 million annually in federal funding, ineligible for Medicaid reimbursements or federal family planning grants. This could prompt one or two female GOP senators to defect. Moderates note that there\u2019s already a ban on using federal funds to pay for abortions. Planned Parenthood provides routine medical care to millions of women \u2013 care that is jeopardized under the House plan.</p> <p><strong>The White House recently offered Planned Parenthood a deal: Its funding can stay if it stops performing work related to abortions</strong>, Maggie Haberman scooped <a href=\"https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/us/politics/planned-parenthood.html\">in the New York Times</a>. <strong>The group firmly rejected this.</strong> \u201cIn private discussions with people close to Planned Parenthood, White House officials have suggested that there could even be an increase in federal earmarks,\u201d Haberman reports.</p> <p><strong>Ivanka Trump has been trying to save the group\u2019s funding stream from social conservatives, urging her father to go gently. </strong>The president took heat during the campaign for praising some of the work Planned Parenthood does, even as he opposed taxpayer funding for abortions.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-center horizontal-photo\"> <img class=\"zoom-in\" src=\"https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/54d288e1289fb5d5688894d82923a249-908-605-646782294.jpg\"> <div class=\"pb-caption\"> Donald Trump hosts Mick Mulvaney, Kevin McCarthy, Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan and John Cornyn during a working lunch in the Roosevelt Room at the White House last week.

Since 2000, West Virginia has voted for only Republicans for president, its congressional delegation has turned from all Democrats to all Republicans except Manchin, and the state legislature in 2014 flipped to GOP control for the first time in 83 years. And during this transformative span, exactly one statewide Democrat won again and again. Manchin gauged the political makeup of the state and chose pragmatism over ideological purity. His calculus paid off. By 2005, he was the governor, a tax-cutting, anti-abortion, pro-gun Democrat\u2014an overall political portrait that hasn\u2019t changed. His many supporters say it\u2019s because Manchin, 69, is skilled and shrewd and pragmatic. His many critics say it\u2019s because he\u2019s politically pliable and driven by instincts of self-preservation.

The Energy and Commerce draft is here.)\n\nThe proposals let people stay on their parents\u2019 plans until they turn 26 and forbid insurers from denying coverage or charging more to people with preexisting conditions. There would be no more individual mandate, but to prod people to pay for coverage insurers would be given permission to impose a surcharge of 30 percent on customers who have a gap between plans.\n\n-- But here\u2019s the rub: We don\u2019t know how many people will lose coverage or how much this might blow up the deficit over time. What was released last night has not been scored by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. This is a big deal because both House committees with jurisdiction plan to take up the legislation tomorrow and advance the overhaul without this kind of formal analysis.\n\nHouse GOP leadership created a \u201cfrequently asked questions\u201d web site to accompany the draft legislation. One question is, \u201cHow are you paying for this plan? How much is it going to cost taxpayers?\u201d This is the answer in full: \u201cWe are still discussing details, but we are committed to repealing Obamacare and replacing it with fiscally responsible policies that restore the free market and protect taxpayers.\u201d\n\n-- What we do know from the drafts is that there are huge tax breaks for some of the richest Americans:\n\n\u201cHouseholds at the top of the U.S. income ladder would see taxes on their wages and investments drop under the House Republicans\u2019 new health-care proposal,\u201d the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Richard Rubin notes. \u201cAs expected, the bill repeals a 3.8% tax on investment income and a 0.9% tax on wages. Both levies affect only the highest-earning households, those individuals making at least $200,000 and married couples making more than $250,000.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Republican plan (also) includes a tax break for insurance company executives making over $500,000 per year,\u201d BuzzFeed\u2019s Paul McLeod observes. \u201cCompanies can generally deduct employee salaries as a business expense but in 2013 the ACA capped the deductions on health insurance executive salaries at $500,000. The average compensation for top health insurance executives is in the millions. In 2014 the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies found that this cap generated $72 million in additional tax revenue.\u201d The draft explicitly eliminates the cap, so the more insurance companies pay their executives the less they will pay in taxes.\n\n-- Policy experts bemoan the lack of a CBO score.\n\nFrom a health economist who teaches at Boston University and does work for the Department of Veterans Affairs:\n\nWhat do we want? A CBO score!\n\n\n\nWhen do we want it? Before committee votes! \u2014 Austin Frakt (@afrakt) March 7, 2017\n\nIn the movie version, CBO staff pull an all-nighter and produce a devastating, yet accurate, score tomorrow. \u2014 Austin Frakt (@afrakt) March 7, 2017\n\nAfter a first read, a health care expert linked to Brookings estimates that 15 million people could lose coverage:\n\nReading through the House GOP bill, it's hard to imagine the coverage loss is any less than 15M versus the ACA. \u2014 Loren Adler (@LorenAdler) March 7, 2017\n\n(5/5) The bill does seem like it would reduce deficits on net, though. Large Medicaid cuts, tax credit cuts, fewer insured outweigh tax cuts \u2014 Loren Adler (@LorenAdler) March 7, 2017\n\n-- Reconciliation is a hurdle. Normally, getting rid of Obamacare would require 60 votes in the Senate. Because Republicans only have 52 seats, they\u2019re using the budget process known as reconciliation (which requires only a simple majority) to get this through. But the rules of the chamber require that any bill passed by reconciliation cannot increase the deficit after it first 10 years in effect. This may force some compromises.\n\nFrom a senior VP at the Kaiser Family Foundation:\n\nOne wonders whether House Republicans would like to make bigger changes to the ACA, but are limited by budget reconciliation rules. \u2014 Larry Levitt (@larry_levitt) March 7, 2017\n\nEliminating the ACA's individual mandate penalty and lowering tax credits will decrease the number of healthy people buying insurance. \u2014 Larry Levitt (@larry_levitt) March 7, 2017\n\nThe ACA is not in a death spiral. The House GOP bill may provide some stability in 2018, but over time it could make the market less stable. \u2014 Larry Levitt (@larry_levitt) March 7, 2017\n\n-- House Republicans are defending the process, arguing that bills regularly go through the markup process without a formal CBO score. (Kevin Brady and Greg Walden, the committee chairmen who released the drafts, tout their proposal in an op-ed.)\n\n-- Progressives are attacking Republicans for hypocrisy. They say we\u2019re talking about an overhaul of a sector that accounts for one-fifth of the economy without a clear sense of the consequences.\n\nFrom the head of the Center for American Progress (who would\u2019ve been on the shortlist to be HHS secretary under Hillary Clinton):\n\nVoting before the CBO score is the giveaway that this GOP health care bill is a lemon. \u2014 Neera Tanden (@neeratanden) March 7, 2017\n\nA Tennessee congressman:\n\nNo CBO score. Reckless to vote when we don't know cost or how many people lose coverage. https://t.co/h8PrkgJrIP \u2014 Jim Cooper (@repjimcooper) March 7, 2017\n\nThe Wall Street financier who ran Obama\u2019s auto rescue task force:\n\nRs are rushing the vote before CBO score because they know their plan will cost millions their insurance. https://t.co/F9CnxI1yXT \u2014 Steven Rattner (@SteveRattner) March 7, 2017\n\nA Democratic operative:\n\nThe same @HouseGOP that accused Democrats of ramming through the ACA (after months of debate) will force a healthcare vote w/o a CBO score. \u2014 Nicholas Blake (@NCBlake) March 7, 2017\n\nAn editor at ThinkProgress:\n\n5. GOP delayed an earlier roll out because the CBO score was so bad. Instead of improving the bill, they just released it w/o a score \u2014 Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) March 7, 2017\n\n6. This also exposes the myth of Ryan as a \"policy wonk.\" Would a policy wonk release a plan w/o knowing its cost or who it would cover? \u2014 Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) March 7, 2017\n\nOther key elements of the draft bill:\n\n-- Individual tax credits, designed to replace the federal insurance subsidy, will be tied to age and income. \u201cThe tax credits outlined by the Ways and Means Committee\u2019s portion of the legislation incorporate an approach that Republicans have long criticized: income-based aid to help Americans afford health coverage,\u201d Amy Goldstein, Mike DeBonis and Kelsey Snell report. \u201cUntil now, the GOP had been intending to veer away from the ACA subsidies that help poor and middle-class people obtain insurance, insisting that the size of tax credits with which they planned to replace the subsidies should be based entirely on people\u2019s ages and not their incomes. But the drafts propose refundable tax credits that would hinge on earnings as well as age \u2014 providing bigger credits for older and poorer Americans.\u201d\n\nWhy conservatives didn\u2019t want to take income into account: It requires getting the IRS involved to verify assets, which means more government employees are involved.\n\nSo why the change? The income-based phase-out of the credit allows the GOP plan to be funded without taxes on employer-provided insurance that had been considered earlier in the drafting process.\n\n-- Medicaid costs will be pushed toward the states over time. The Medicaid expansion would stop in 2020, for all intents and purposes. The program would set a per capita cap on funding to states, depending on how many people are enrolled. This could potentially be a problem in the Senate, where four Republicans yesterday promised to oppose any bill that would hurt expansion states. \u201cWe will not support a plan that does not include stability for Medicaid expansion populations or flexibility for states,\u201d Rob Portman (Ohio), Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), Cory Gardner (Colo.) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) wrote.\n\n-- Planned Parenthood gets defunded. The bill makes the women\u2019s health organization, which receives about $500 million annually in federal funding, ineligible for Medicaid reimbursements or federal family planning grants. This could prompt one or two female GOP senators to defect. Moderates note that there\u2019s already a ban on using federal funds to pay for abortions. Planned Parenthood provides routine medical care to millions of women \u2013 care that is jeopardized under the House plan.\n\nThe White House recently offered Planned Parenthood a deal: Its funding can stay if it stops performing work related to abortions, Maggie Haberman scooped in the New York Times. The group firmly rejected this. \u201cIn private discussions with people close to Planned Parenthood, White House officials have suggested that there could even be an increase in federal earmarks,\u201d Haberman reports.\n\nIvanka Trump has been trying to save the group\u2019s funding stream from social conservatives, urging her father to go gently. The president took heat during the campaign for praising some of the work Planned Parenthood does, even as he opposed taxpayer funding for abortions.\n\nDonald Trump hosts Mick Mulvaney, Kevin McCarthy, Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan and John Cornyn during a working lunch in the Roosevelt Room at the White House last week.

From Kimberly Kindy: \u201cIn a narrow result that divided along party lines, the Senate voted 49 to 48 to eliminate the regulation, dubbed the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule. Finalized in August and blocked by a court order in October, the rule would limit the ability of companies with recent safety problems to complete for government contracts unless they agreed to remedies. The measure to abolish it had already cleared the House. Trump is expected to sign it. A half-dozen other worker safety regulations are in Republican crosshairs, with one headed to the Senate floor as soon as this week.\"\n\nNorth Korea fires four ballistic missiles into the sea off of Japan's coast. (Ryan Brooks).\n\nTHE WORLD IS ON FIRE --\n\nESCALATION IN PYONGYANG:\n\n-- \u201cNorth Korea was practicing to strike United States military bases in Japan with its latest barrage of missiles, state media reported, and it appears to be trying to outsmart a new American antimissile battery being deployed to South Korea by firing multiple rockets at once,\" Anna Fifield reports: \u201cKim Jong Un presided over Monday\u2019s launch of the four missiles \u2026. in a statement that analysts called a \u2018brazen declaration\u2019 of the country\u2019s intent to strike enemies with a nuclear weapon if it came under attack. North Korea has tested these types of missiles before, so the point of Monday\u2019s launches was not to see if the rockets would fly, but to test how quickly the unit could set them up and deploy them \u2014 classic training for a wartime situation, said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program.\"\n\n-- The U.S. military began deploying an advanced defensive missile system known as THAAD to South Korea yesterday, a long-awaited move that was first agreed upon in Seoul last summer. The deployment comes despite protests from Chinese officials, who have repeatedly said such deployments come as a threat to Chinese security. One drawback: THAAD would have a hard time intercepting four ballistic missiles that were launched simultaneously, which is one of the reasons it was so worrisome to Pentagon officials when the North Koreans tested multiple weapons at once. (Dan Lamothe)\n\n-- In another subplot, Kim Jong Un has banned all Malaysian citizens from leaving North Korea to retaliate against that country for investigating the assassination of his half-brother (a hit that South Korean intelligence agencies allege he ordered). This led Malaysia's prime minister to accuse Pyongyang of \u201cholding our citizens hostage.\" In response, the Malaysian government quickly moved to ban North Korean diplomats from leaving their country -- surrounding the embassy with tape and armed police to ensure the officials stay put. (Anna Fifield)\n\nTEHRAN IS TAUNTING US:\n\n-- Swift-moving Iranian vessels came dangerously close to a U.S. Navy surveillance ship in the Strait of Hormuz, U.S. officials disclosed last night. \"The apparent harassment of the USS Invincible on two occasions, on Thursday and Saturday, came amid Iranian state media reports that Iran had tested its newly acquired S-300 missile air defense system that is designed to intercept incoming missiles,\" Carol Morello reports. \"In addition, Fox News reported that Iran had itself test-fired a pair of ballistic missiles that destroyed a floating barge over the weekend, but that could not be independently confirmed.

Matt Zapotosky reports: \u201cIn what he framed as a supplement to his testimony during his January confirmation hearing, Sessions acknowledged that he spoke briefly to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July and that he met with Kislyak in his Senate office in September.

This is undoubtedly not their intent. No one in the party wants to help Russia harm the United States and its democratic institutions. But Republicans need to face the fact that by slowing down, limiting or otherwise hampering the fullest possible investigation into what happened, that is what they are doing. It\u2019s time for the party to put national security above partisan interest. Republican leaders need to name a bipartisan select committee or create an outside panel, and they need to do so immediately. They must give that committee the mission and all the necessary means for getting to the bottom of what happened last year.\"\n\n-- Walter Pincus, one of the wisest men and most experienced journalists in Washington, puts this donnybrook in context: \u201cI\u2019ve covered many political scandals over the past 50 years, including Watergate, Iran-contra, and the Clinton impeachment, but the past few weeks have convinced me this country may be on the verge of one that may top them all,\u201d Pincus writes on The Cipher Brief. \u201cNone of them involved a president as unprepared as Donald J.

(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nA WHITE HOUSE UNDER SIEGE:\n\n-- Aides spent Monday contorting themselves as they attempted to defend Trump\u2019s unfounded claims that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower at the end of the presidential campaign. Illustrating the uncomfortable situation the president\u2019s tweets created for his aides, the normally media-hungry White House went largely dark. Though Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders took to the airwaves to defend Trump in a series of television interviews, Sean Spicer did not allow cameras into the briefing room for his new conference Monday and Trump signed an executive order for his revamped travel ban in private so that he would not need to answer shouted questions from the press. Speaking to reporters off-camera, Spicer refused to add clarity or context to Trump\u2019s Twitter missives. \"I\u2019m just going to let the tweet speak for itself,\" the press secretary said. (Ashley Parker and Jenna Johnson)\n\n-- Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, is trying to force James Comey\u2019s hand by calling on him to put up or shut up in the Wall Street Journal: \u201cIf Director Comey has something to say about this perhaps he can just issue a statement or be more explicit,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know he\u2019s not shy. Did he actually ask the Department of Justice to do this, and what is he asking them? One assumes if he has something to say, he can just say it.\u201d The FBI declined to comment on Conway\u2019s call for a statement from Comey, and there appears to be no plans for him to speak out.\n\n-- Other Republicans, meanwhile, expressed concern about revelations that the FBI considered paying a British spy as part of an inquiry into Russian interference: Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) asked Comey yesterday to provide details of such a plan, saying \u201cit raises substantial questions about the bureau\u2019s independence, as well as the Obama administration\u2019s use of law enforcement and intelligence agencies for political ends.\u201d (Tom Hamburger)\n\n-- LAWYERING UP: The White House is bulking up the counsel's office, with 26 attorneys, as it girds for a complicated mix of ethical problems and other brewing fights that could imperil the president. For context, there are more than twice as many lawyers now as there were at this stage in George W. Bush's administration. The Associated Press\u2019s Julie Bykowicz says Trump\u2019s counsel office appears slightly larger than the 22 attorneys Obama had. Bush only had a dozen lawyers during the early years of his administration, but the office grew to 26 by the time he left office (remember the U.S. attorney scandal). The Trump team includes four attorneys who had been with Jones Day, the alma mater of White House Counsel Don McGahn. \u201cThis counsel\u2019s office also includes a special ethics counselor, Stefan Passantino, and three other senior attorneys dedicated to that topic,\u201d Julie notes. \u201cTrump, who continues to profit from his global business empire, and his Cabinet \u2026 pose a bounty of ethics questions for McGahn\u2019s team.\u201d\n\n-- A former British legislator is at the heart of Trump's explosive allegations against Obama. But who exactly is Louise Mensch? Karla Adam reports from London: \"For starters, the politician-turned-journalist is the writer behind an article published on the eve of the election titled: \u2018EXCLUSIVE: FBI \u2018Granted FISA Warrant\u2019 Covering Trump Camp\u2019s Ties To Russia.\u2019 In tweets on Monday, Mensch emphasized that her reporting does not back up Trump\u2019s wiretapping claim, even though the White House cited her article to justify the allegation. Mensch, who is based in New York, said her sources contacted her because of her outspoken backing for the intelligence community. Anyone who follows her on Twitter \u2014 and more than 170,000 people do \u2014 knows that she is not a Trump supporter and has been probing Trump-Russia links for some time. \u2026 In Britain, Mensch is best known for her stint as a Conservative lawmaker and for her work as a successful chick-lit novelist under her maiden name, Louise Bagshawe.\u201d\n\nTRUMP'S TRAVEL BAN, TAKE TWO:\n\n-- The president signed a revised executive order on Monday that bans travelers from six Muslim-majority countries from getting new visas. It also suspends the U.S. refugee program for 120 days, and limits the number of refugees accepted into the U.S. to 50,000 a year, down from the 110,000 cap set by the Obama administration. Matt Zapotosky, David Nakamura and Abigail Hauslohner report: \u201cThe new guidelines mark a dramatic departure from Trump\u2019s original ban \u2026 [laying] out a far more specific national security basis for the order, blocks the issuance only of new visas, and ... omitting Iraq. The order also details specific sets of people who would be able to apply for case-by-case waivers to the order, including those previously admitted to the United States for 'a continuous period of work, study, or other long-term activity'; those with 'significant business or professional obligations'; and those seeking to visit or live with family.\u201d Democrats and civil liberties groups say the revised order is legally tainted in the same way as the first one: it is a thinly-disguised Muslim ban. Possibly because it was rolled out on a Monday, there were no huge protests yesterday. (Read the full text of the new order.)\n\n-- Like the previous ban, this would not have kept out of the United States anyone responsible for a deadly terror attack since 2001. In fact, since 9/11, every deadly jihadist attack in the U.S. was carried out by a U.S. citizen or legal resident.

Literally,\u201d by Chris Mooney and Steven Mufson: \u201cThe White House and ExxonMobil were in sync Monday. Some might even call it a mind meld. In a news release, ExxonMobil highlighted the oil giant\u2019s plan to spend $20 billion over 10 years, build 11 chemical and natural-gas projects and create 45,000 jobs. Within the same hour, the White House put out its own statement claiming credit for the expansion and adding, \u2018The spirit of optimism sweeping the country is already boosting job growth, and it is only the beginning.\u2019 One full paragraph appeared nearly identically word for word in each release. Another sentence appeared almost verbatim elsewhere. ExxonMobil spokesman Alan T.

Darryl Fears reports: \u201cThe Trump administration on Monday announced an offshore oil and gas drilling proposal in the Gulf of Mexico that appears to mirror a plan offered by his predecessor a few months ago. In one of his first acts after last week\u2019s Senate confirmation, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke proposed leasing 73 million acres off Florida, Alabama, Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi over five years starting in August. The offer includes more than 13,700 lease blocks extending three miles to 230 miles offshore \u2026 But the plan is similar to a five-year proposal by the Obama administration to lease 66 million acres in the same location \u2026 [Then-interior secretary] Sally Jewell, said the proposal\u2019s leases were focused \u2018in the best places \u2014 those with the highest resource potential, lowest conflict and established infrastructure \u2014 and removes regions that are simply not right to lease.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s first budget proposal this month will not include any specific changes to the tax code or big programs like Medicare and Social Security, a White House official said this week, and will focus instead on a \u201cpiecemeal\u201d system that aims to boost defense spending and slash other programs annually authorized by Congress. The proposal is slated for release around March 16, an OMB spokesperson said. (Damian Paletta)\n\n-- Congressional Republicans are poised to overturn as early as this week Obama-era education regulations outlining how states must carry out a U.S. law holding public schools accountable for serving all students. GOP lawmakers claim the so-called accountability laws are an executive overreach, while Democrats argue that doing away with such regulations could open \u201cloopholes\u201d to hide or otherwise ignore schools that fail to adequately serve poor children, minorities, and students with disabilities.

(Politico)\n\n-- TRANSPARENCY WATCH: Democratic lawmakers are urging the president to release the logs of visitors to the White House and his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach. So far, Trump has not continued an Obama-era policy that made public the names of his nearly six million White House visitors. Reuters reports: \u201cThe White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A page on the White House website's 'Disclosures' section entitled 'Visitor Access Records' says the page will post records of White House visitors on an ongoing basis, once they become available. It does not mention Mar-a-Lago. [Meanwhile a group of] senators sent a similar letter on Monday to William Callahan, deputy director of the U.S. Secret Service, asking how the agency will conduct background checks on people who will be present during Trump's trips to Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower in New York City, Trump's golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, or other Trump properties where he may conduct official business.\u201d\n\nGAFFE OF THE DAY:\n\n-- Ben Carson, in his first official remarks as HUD secretary, described slaves as \"immigrants.\" Continuing an embarrassing pattern of missteps on race for the Trump administration, Carson told a room packed with hundreds of federal workers that the Africans captured, sold and transported to America against their will had the same hopes and dreams as early immigrants. \"That's what America is about. A land of dreams and opportunity. There were other immigrants who came here in the bottom of slave ships, worked even longer, even harder for less,\" said Carson, speaking extemporaneously as he paced the room with a microphone. \"But they, too, had a dream.\" His comments were broadcast live to all of HUD\u2019s regional field offices, as well as the public.(Tracy Jan and Jose A.

Other Olympic sport governing bodies lacked basic sex abuse prevention measures that were commonplace at the time, former USA Gymnastics CEO Bob Colarossi wrote in a letter, and child athletes were at risk as a result. Colarossi\u2019s letter, part of court documents and testimony unsealed Friday, is evidence that sex abuse of child athletes in Olympic sports was a well-known issue long before the USOC first required all Olympic sport organizations to implement preventive measures such as criminal background checks, abuse education programs, and policies for how to handle sexual misconduct allegations in 2014. \u2018This is not an issue that can be wished away,\u2019 Colarossi wrote more than 14 years earlier to three USOC executives, including current CEO Scott Blackmun. Colarossi\u2019s letter, and associated testimony \u2026. also shows how enduring confusion over the federal law that governs Olympic sports organizations has hampered child protection efforts.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cGOPers say they want to punish alleged sexual predators in government. Ryan Zinke has a test case,\u201d by Lisa Rein: \u201cOn his first day as Interior Secretary last week, Ryan Zinke sent his 70,000 employees a stern email on ethics, warning them, \u2018I expect us to do better\u2019 after a pattern of \u2018lapses in judgment by a few employees.\u2019 Days before his swearing-in, the agency\u2019s watchdog published an investigation that disclosed a pattern of sexual harassment by a senior law enforcement official. How the alleged misconduct is addressed will test just how committed Zinke, the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress are to holding accountable employees who break the rules. The law enforcement official, Tim K. Lynn \u2026 acted inappropriately toward six women, touching, hugging, text-messaging and flirting with them at the office and discussing \u2018inappropriate\u2019 subjects \u2026 Lynn, a former law enforcement officer with the U.S. Forest Service and Secret Service, was recently promoted to senior executive in his current job \u2026 An agency spokeswoman said the department is reviewing Lynn\u2019s case in order to decide what action should be taken.\u201d Meanwhile, Rep.

Finally, Delana called the gun shop a few miles from her home, the one that had sold her daughter a black Hi-Point pistol a month earlier \u2026 Her daughter had been in and out of mental hospitals, she told the store manager, and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. She had tried to kill herself \u2026 [and now] Delana worried that her daughter would go back. \u2018I\u2019m begging you as a mother, if she comes in, please don\u2019t sell her a gun,\u2019 Delana said through tears. \u2026 At the Odessa Gun & Pawn shop, Weathers approached a manager: \u2018Something like what I bought last time.\u2019 An hour after leaving the gun store, Weathers was back home where her father sat at a computer with his back to her.

But when you take into account the many French voters who are saying, \u2018We\u2019ve tried everything else; why not this?\u2019\u2014voters who, consciously or not, would appear to prefer a tempest to boredom and who advocate \u2018stirring things up\u2019 \u2026 when you consider the volatile combination of our national anxieties and the ambient nihilism; when you behold the seemingly irresistible temptation to rouse a sluggish patient even by drastic means \u2026 well, all of that may indeed make up an explosive cocktail. And it does indeed seem to suggest a series of imperceptible shifts that add up to this: for the first time, the irresponsible, xenophobic, and crypto-fascist Marine Le Pen has the wind behind her and could, in fact, become France\u2019s next president.\u201d\n\n-- Politico Magazine, \u201cManchin in the Middle,\u201d by Michael Kruse and Burgess Everett: \u201cJoe Manchin\u2019s ascent as a Democrat in West Virginia is remarkable given that it has coincided with his state\u2019s lurch from being one of the most resolutely blue to one of the most reliably red. Since 2000, West Virginia has voted for only Republicans for president, its congressional delegation has turned from all Democrats to all Republicans except Manchin, and the state legislature in 2014 flipped to GOP control for the first time in 83 years. And during this transformative span, exactly one statewide Democrat won again and again. Manchin gauged the political makeup of the state and chose pragmatism over ideological purity. His calculus paid off. By 2005, he was the governor, a tax-cutting, anti-abortion, pro-gun Democrat\u2014an overall political portrait that hasn\u2019t changed. His many supporters say it\u2019s because Manchin, 69, is skilled and shrewd and pragmatic. His many critics say it\u2019s because he\u2019s politically pliable and driven by instincts of self-preservation.
