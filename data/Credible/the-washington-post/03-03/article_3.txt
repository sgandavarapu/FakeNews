A steady procession of guests, from steelworkers to congressmen and the presidents of historically black colleges, has flanked him as he rolled back environmental protections, took aim at Dodd-Frank and killed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Ever the showman, Trump even postponed his second attempt at a travel ban, which had been scheduled for Wednesday, so that it could get <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/28/politics/trump-travel-ban-visa-holders/\">a news cycle to itself</a>.</p> <p><strong>With that in mind, it should speak volumes when Trump does <em>not</em> invite camera crews into the Oval Office to film him taking action.</strong> Three recent examples illustrate this:</p> <div class=\"inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-center horizontal-photo\"> <img class=\"zoom-in\" src=\"https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/2e81809cdd60f307a2f78e1ca78df3d4-908-588-05821415.jpg\"> <div class=\"pb-caption\"> Trump signs two House resolutions to encourage women and girls to study and pursue careers in science on Tuesday. (Erik S. Lesser/EPA) </div> </div> <p><strong>MAKING IT EASIER FOR MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE TO GET GUNS:</strong></p> <p>On Tuesday, Trump participated in a flashy photo op&nbsp;to sign two feel-good resolutions. The \u201cPromoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act\u201d authorizes the National Science Foundation to encourage females to become entrepreneurs. The \u201cInspiring the Next Space Pioneers, Innovators, Researchers, and Explorers Women Act\u201d says NASA should urge young girls to study science. Neither of these measures provides even one dollar to help advance these worthy aims, which is why they passed Congress unanimously by voice votes.</p> <p>During a lunch with the anchors from all the major networks, meanwhile, Trump suggested that he could get behind a grand bargain to enact comprehensive immigration reform. This turned out to be a big head fake, but it nonetheless dominated the conversation during the run-up to his maiden speech before a joint session of Congress that evening.</p> <p><strong>While the press corps was distracted and the cable channels aired footage of Trump surrounded by a bipartisan group of smiling women, behind closed doors and with no fanfare the president quietly signed a measure that killed a regulation enacted by the Obama administration to tighten gun background checks.</strong></p> <p>The rule required the Social Security Administration to send over the names of people who receive government checks for being mentally disabled and others who have been deemed unable to handle their own financial affairs to the FBI office that runs the national background check database. This is a universe of about 75,000 people.</p> <p>The National Rifle Association says the rule&nbsp;curtails the Second Amendment rights of these people and persuaded&nbsp;GOP leadership to use the Congressional Review Act to undo it. Under the Constitution, Trump had 10 days to sign off. By waiting until the day before the deadline to do so, when there were so many big stories in the mix, he ensured it got minimal coverage.</p> <p><strong>In a normal time, with a conventional president, undoing this regulation would have been front-page news. </strong>Trump\u2019s move would have sparked a national conversation about the country\u2019s continuing failure to seriously address both gun violence and mental illness. Major publications would have run deeper stories about <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/01/19/fbi-guns-background-checks/78752774/\">how flawed</a> the national <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-accused-charleston-shooter-should-not-have-been-able-to-buy-gun/2015/07/10/0d09fda0-271f-11e5-b72c-2b7d516e1e0e_story.html?utm_term=.a64d69aa1024\">background check</a> system is five years after the massacre at Sandy Hook, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/lack-of-data-makes-it-hard-for-background-checks-system-to-work-properly/2014/08/28/d166c1b4-2ed8-11e4-be9e-60cc44c01e7f_story.html?utm_term=.2e0e44b43029\">with an emphasis</a> on the gun lobby\u2019s role in keeping it that way.</p> <p><strong>But in the current news environment, with the Trump administration running a blitzkrieg offense and the attorney general embattled for concealing secret meetings with the Russian ambassador while under oath before Congress, it\u2019s very hard for anyone to stay on top of everything. </strong>Not only does the media have limited bandwidth, but cable producers are always reluctant to give much airtime to issues that don\u2019t have obvious visuals.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) </div> </div> <p><strong>CHANGING THE DOJ LINE OF SUCCESSION:</strong></p> <p>On the same day that Jeff Sessions was sworn in, <strong>Trump quietly signed an executive order to change the order of succession at the Justice Department if the attorney general resigns. </strong></p> <p>It was significant because the president had just fired Sally Yates as acting AG after she wouldn\u2019t defend his travel ban. As he was entitled to do, <strong>Trump went outside the official order of succession to elevate Dana Boente</strong>, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to replace her. A week before his term ended, <strong>Barack Obama had (also without fanfare) changed the order of succession to remove Boente from the list.</strong></p> <p>Because the Senate hasn\u2019t yet confirmed Trump\u2019s nominee for deputy AG, Boente is now serving in that role on an acting basis. <strong>Sessions\u2019s recusal himself from overseeing the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation means it will be handled by Boente.</strong></p> <p><strong>In an indication that they didn\u2019t want to draw attention to this, it\u2019s worth noting that Trump signed three other orders in front of reporters immediately after Sessions was sworn in. </strong>Each was noncontroversial: One would \"break the back of the criminal cartels that have spread across our nation and are destroying the blood of our youth,\u201d the president told the assembled press pool. The other would create a \"task force on reducing violent crime,\u201d he said. And the third would instruct DOJ to implement a plan to stop crime against law enforcement officers.</p> <p><strong>Basically no one noticed Trump\u2019s fourth order.</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/10/trump-executive-order-obama-justice-department-succession/97752898/\">A USA Today reporter noticed</a> that it was dated on a Thursday but didn\u2019t appear on an official web site that lists such actions until Friday.

And there\u2019s a lot of problems,\u201d he said at the time, before later backing off under pressure. \u201cLeave it the way it is.\u201d Upsetting the religious right, Trump also said after the election that gay marriage is \u201csettled\u201d law after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.</p> <p><strong>Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared, both top advisers, also tend to be extremely uneasy with the kinds of socially divisive executive actions that will offend their 30-something liberal socialite friends in Manhattan</strong>, whose cocktail parties they want to continue getting invited to.

They give as much exposure as possible to good news and dump bad news on Friday nights when people are checking out for the weekend. They hand out some scooplets to favored reporters at friendly outlets to get the spin they want on them. When there\u2019s a lot happening, they disclose uncomfortable or embarrassing stuff that they don\u2019t want to get much attention. This is how every modern administration works, and it is the duty of White House reporters to resist getting played, no matter who is in power.</p> <p><strong>-- Trump, though, cares more about showmanship than any modern president, at least since Mike Deaver worked in the White House during Ronald Reagan\u2019s first term. </strong>That\u2019s why he routinely talks as if he is directing a movie instead of leading a country. It\u2019s why he complained privately to several people about Sean Spicer\u2019s ill-fitting suit after his press secretary\u2019s disastrous debut in the briefing room. Speaking to a group of governors at the White House earlier this week, Trump pointed out Mike Pence. \u201cHe\u2019s a real talent,\u201d the president said. \u201cAnd he is central casting, do we agree? Central casting!\u201d</p> <p><strong>As he picked his Cabinet, Trump constantly told aides that he wanted his secretaries to look the part.</strong> He reportedly thought Rex Tillerson looked like a diplomat.

'I was only trying to stop a war,' Sater said of his role linking [lawmaker Andrei Artemenko] with Cohen.\u201d The Times had quoted Cohen as saying he gave the envelope containing the proposal to ousted Trump adviser Michael Flynn -- but now he has reversed course.

(Alex Brandon/AP)\n\nWith Breanne Deppisch\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: The deconstruction of the administrative state will not be televised.\n\nDonald Trump is eager to look like a man of action, pulling the levers of government and redirecting the ship of state. The president has had a photo op to reinforce this narrative nearly every day since taking office. A steady procession of guests, from steelworkers to congressmen and the presidents of historically black colleges, has flanked him as he rolled back environmental protections, took aim at Dodd-Frank and killed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Ever the showman, Trump even postponed his second attempt at a travel ban, which had been scheduled for Wednesday, so that it could get a news cycle to itself.\n\nWith that in mind, it should speak volumes when Trump does not invite camera crews into the Oval Office to film him taking action. Three recent examples illustrate this:\n\nTrump signs two House resolutions to encourage women and girls to study and pursue careers in science on Tuesday. (Erik S. Lesser/EPA)\n\nMAKING IT EASIER FOR MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE TO GET GUNS:\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump participated in a flashy photo op to sign two feel-good resolutions. The \u201cPromoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act\u201d authorizes the National Science Foundation to encourage females to become entrepreneurs. The \u201cInspiring the Next Space Pioneers, Innovators, Researchers, and Explorers Women Act\u201d says NASA should urge young girls to study science. Neither of these measures provides even one dollar to help advance these worthy aims, which is why they passed Congress unanimously by voice votes.\n\nDuring a lunch with the anchors from all the major networks, meanwhile, Trump suggested that he could get behind a grand bargain to enact comprehensive immigration reform. This turned out to be a big head fake, but it nonetheless dominated the conversation during the run-up to his maiden speech before a joint session of Congress that evening.\n\nWhile the press corps was distracted and the cable channels aired footage of Trump surrounded by a bipartisan group of smiling women, behind closed doors and with no fanfare the president quietly signed a measure that killed a regulation enacted by the Obama administration to tighten gun background checks.\n\nThe rule required the Social Security Administration to send over the names of people who receive government checks for being mentally disabled and others who have been deemed unable to handle their own financial affairs to the FBI office that runs the national background check database. This is a universe of about 75,000 people.\n\nThe National Rifle Association says the rule curtails the Second Amendment rights of these people and persuaded GOP leadership to use the Congressional Review Act to undo it. Under the Constitution, Trump had 10 days to sign off. By waiting until the day before the deadline to do so, when there were so many big stories in the mix, he ensured it got minimal coverage.\n\nIn a normal time, with a conventional president, undoing this regulation would have been front-page news. Trump\u2019s move would have sparked a national conversation about the country\u2019s continuing failure to seriously address both gun violence and mental illness. Major publications would have run deeper stories about how flawed the national background check system is five years after the massacre at Sandy Hook, with an emphasis on the gun lobby\u2019s role in keeping it that way.\n\nBut in the current news environment, with the Trump administration running a blitzkrieg offense and the attorney general embattled for concealing secret meetings with the Russian ambassador while under oath before Congress, it\u2019s very hard for anyone to stay on top of everything. Not only does the media have limited bandwidth, but cable producers are always reluctant to give much airtime to issues that don\u2019t have obvious visuals. (Three White House spokeswomen did not respond to a request for comment about the decision to sign the gun measure off camera.)\n\nPresident Trump watches as Vice President Pence administers the oath of office to Jeff Sessions, accompanied by his wife Mary, in the Oval Office on Feb. 9. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nCHANGING THE DOJ LINE OF SUCCESSION:\n\nOn the same day that Jeff Sessions was sworn in, Trump quietly signed an executive order to change the order of succession at the Justice Department if the attorney general resigns.\n\nIt was significant because the president had just fired Sally Yates as acting AG after she wouldn\u2019t defend his travel ban. As he was entitled to do, Trump went outside the official order of succession to elevate Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to replace her. A week before his term ended, Barack Obama had (also without fanfare) changed the order of succession to remove Boente from the list.\n\nBecause the Senate hasn\u2019t yet confirmed Trump\u2019s nominee for deputy AG, Boente is now serving in that role on an acting basis. Sessions\u2019s recusal himself from overseeing the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation means it will be handled by Boente.\n\nIn an indication that they didn\u2019t want to draw attention to this, it\u2019s worth noting that Trump signed three other orders in front of reporters immediately after Sessions was sworn in. Each was noncontroversial: One would \"break the back of the criminal cartels that have spread across our nation and are destroying the blood of our youth,\u201d the president told the assembled press pool. The other would create a \"task force on reducing violent crime,\u201d he said. And the third would instruct DOJ to implement a plan to stop crime against law enforcement officers.\n\nBasically no one noticed Trump\u2019s fourth order. A USA Today reporter noticed that it was dated on a Thursday but didn\u2019t appear on an official web site that lists such actions until Friday. The White House didn\u2019t explain the discrepancy.\n\nGavin Grimm is photographed with his mom in Gloucester, Va., last August. The transgender teen sued the local school board after it barred him from the boys' bathroom. His case is pending before the Supreme Court. (Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post)\n\nREMOVING TRANSGENDER PROTECTIONS:\n\nLast week, the Trump administration revoked federal guidelines specifying that transgender students have the right to use public school restrooms that match their gender identity. It is one of the most significant social policy shifts ushered in by the new president during his first 40 days, which means it was too big of a deal to bury.\n\nBut the White House kept the president himself as far away from it as possible, describing it in a statement as \u201ca joint decision made \u2026 by the Department of Justice and the Department of Education.\u201d\n\nAnyone who knows anything about how government works knows that nothing like this happens without sign-off at the highest levels. In this case, Sessions and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos had been at loggerheads regarding timing and specific language. So others were involved.\n\nThe president could also have had the two department heads come into the Oval Office and made a statement with them behind him, or he could have made a show of signing the memorandum himself. Or he could have even tweeted about it. He didn\u2019t.\n\nCONSIDERING TRUMP\u2019S MOTIVES:\n\n-- The president, a registered Democrat from 2001 to 2009, is not naturally a movement conservative. He knows he must cater to his base, but you can tell that he\u2019s sometimes uncomfortable with it. And it\u2019s very clear that he would prefer his legacy to be more about jobs and the economy than the culture wars.\n\nThere is also little to suggest that Trump is an authentic or in any way committed social conservative. \u201cI\u2019m very pro-choice,\u201d he said in 1999, before changing his position on abortion. Just last April, he came out against North Carolina\u2019s bathroom law as a solution in search of a problem. \u201cThey\u2019re paying a big price. And there\u2019s a lot of problems,\u201d he said at the time, before later backing off under pressure. \u201cLeave it the way it is.\u201d Upsetting the religious right, Trump also said after the election that gay marriage is \u201csettled\u201d law after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\n\nTrump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared, both top advisers, also tend to be extremely uneasy with the kinds of socially divisive executive actions that will offend their 30-something liberal socialite friends in Manhattan, whose cocktail parties they want to continue getting invited to. They killed a draft executive order that would have dramatically expanded the rights of people, businesses and organizations of faith to opt out of laws or activities that violate their religion, such as same-sex wedding ceremonies.\n\nOBSESSED WITH APPEARANCES:\n\n-- Every White House cares about optics, of course. Communications professionals always try to manipulate press coverage. They give as much exposure as possible to good news and dump bad news on Friday nights when people are checking out for the weekend. They hand out some scooplets to favored reporters at friendly outlets to get the spin they want on them. When there\u2019s a lot happening, they disclose uncomfortable or embarrassing stuff that they don\u2019t want to get much attention. This is how every modern administration works, and it is the duty of White House reporters to resist getting played, no matter who is in power.\n\n-- Trump, though, cares more about showmanship than any modern president, at least since Mike Deaver worked in the White House during Ronald Reagan\u2019s first term. That\u2019s why he routinely talks as if he is directing a movie instead of leading a country. It\u2019s why he complained privately to several people about Sean Spicer\u2019s ill-fitting suit after his press secretary\u2019s disastrous debut in the briefing room. Speaking to a group of governors at the White House earlier this week, Trump pointed out Mike Pence. \u201cHe\u2019s a real talent,\u201d the president said. \u201cAnd he is central casting, do we agree? Central casting!\u201d\n\nAs he picked his Cabinet, Trump constantly told aides that he wanted his secretaries to look the part. He reportedly thought Rex Tillerson looked like a diplomat. He loved that James Mattis\u2019s nickname is \u201cMad Dog\u201d (even though the retired general doesn\u2019t like being called that). \u201cI see my generals,\u201d Trump said during the lunch right after the inauguration. \u201cThese are central casting. If I\u2019m doing a movie, I\u2019d pick you general, General Mattis.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s signature showmanship was on display yesterday during his visit to Newport News, Va. He helicoptered onto the deck of the Navy\u2019s newest nuclear-powered warship to try building support for a major hike in military spending. He wore a red \u201cUSA\u201d cap to keep his hair from blowing in the wind when he got off Marine One and then changed into a Navy cap and put on a special green jacket. The president, alongside Mattis, descended in an external elevator built to move planes up and down and emerged to the roar of the crowd. \u201cI have no idea how it looks, but I think it looks good,\u201d Trump told the crowd. \u201cThis is a great-looking hat, just like this is a great-looking ship!\u201d (Philip Rucker's full dispatch from the USS Gerald R. Ford is here.)\n\nYou might also recall how Trump, who still has an executive producer credit on \u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice,\u201d treated his Supreme Court rollout like a reality TV spectacle. As he introduced Neil Gorsuch to the nation in prime time, he ad-libbed with a smile: \u201cSo was that a surprise? Was it!?\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning newsletter.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\n-- Vice President Pence used a private email account to conduct public business as governor of Indiana, including on homeland security matters, and he got hacked. The Indianapolis Star\u2019s Tony Cook reports: \u201c[Newly-released emails] \u2026 show Pence communicated via his personal AOL account with top advisers on topics ranging from security gates at the governor\u2019s residence to the state\u2019s response to terror attacks across the globe. In one email, Pence\u2019s top state homeland security adviser relayed an update from the FBI regarding the arrests of several men on federal terror-related charges. Cyber-security experts say the emails raise concerns about whether such sensitive information was adequately protected from hackers, given that personal accounts like Pence's are typically less secure than government email accounts. In fact, Pence's personal account was hacked last summer.\"\n\n-- Pence isn\u2019t alone. Steven Mufson reports that the new EPA chief may have his own email headache: \u201cAn environmental group and several Democratic senators are demanding a review of the personal email account of Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, after he said during confirmation hearings that he never used that account for official business as Oklahoma state attorney general. ... Yet several of Pruitt\u2019s official emails, released in a lawsuit in Oklahoma, were copied to his personal email \u2014 an Apple account that was partially blacked out before being released.\u201d\n\nGET SMART FAST:\u200b\u200b\n\nThe EPA announced it is halting an inquiry into oil and gas industry emissions of methane, withdrawing a request that requires operators to provide the agency with extensive information as part of an Obama-era climate initiative.

(Hayley Tsukayama) Hillary Clinton spoke at Wellesley last night, addressing students in a private, closed-press event.

When asked by a student \u201cwhat she would change\u201d about her 2016 campaign, Clinton replied, \u201cI\u2019d win.\u201d The 1969 graduate will return in May to speak at the college's commencement ceremony. (Boston Globe) Ben Carson and Rick Perry were easily confirmed to lead HUD and Energy. The vote totals were 58 to 41 and 62 to 37, respectively. Pence swore them in last night. A sharply divided Senate Finance Committee recommended the confirmation of Seema Verma, a health-care consultant, to run the nation\u2019s Medicare and Medicaid programs. On a vote of 13 to 12, with every Democrat in opposition, Verma\u2019s nomination now moves to the full Senate. (Amy Goldstein) The University of Notre Dame announced that Pence will speak at its graduation in May, ending months of speculation and campus protests over whether the school would invite President Trump to deliver the commencement address. Four of the past six presidents \u2014 Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter \u2014 accepted Notre Dame\u2019s invitation in their first year in office. (Joe Heim) Trump snubbed Bobby Scott. Virginia Republican Reps. Rob Wittman and Scott Taylor flew to Newport News on Air Force One with the president. But Rep. Bobby Scott (D), one of the most senior members of the Virginia congressional delegation whose district Trump visited, was not invited to the event.

(Lindsey Bever)\n\nTHERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- In an interview last night on Fox News, Jeff Sessions pointedly declined to say whether Vladimir Putin and his government favored Trump over Hillary Clinton in the presidential race \u2014 even though a declassified U.S. intelligence report released in January concluded exactly that. \u201cI have never been told that,\u201d Sessions told Fox News host Tucker Carlson. \u201cDo you think they did?\u201d Carlson pressed. \u201cI don\u2019t have any idea Tucker, you\u2019d have to ask them,\u201d he replied. This puts him at odds with the FBI that he oversees. Keep reading for much more on the scandal.\n\nSESSIONS CONTINUES TO SHIFT HIS STORY, AS MANY QUESTIONS REMAIN \u2014 A round-up of developments, via Karoun Demirjian, Ed O'Keefe, Sari Horwitz and Matt Zapotosky:\n\n-- Sessions claimed he was already thinking of recusing himself before The Post revealed his two meetings with the Russian ambassador. \u201cSpeaking at a hastily called news conference at the Justice Department, Sessions said he was following the recommendation of department ethics officials after an evaluation of the rules and cases in which he might have a conflict. \u2018They said that since I had involvement with the campaign, I should not be involved in any campaign investigation,\u2019 Sessions said. That represents a departure from Sessions\u2019s previous statements, including one on Monday, when he declined to say whether he would recuse himself.\u201d\n\n-- Under oath, Sessions said on Jan. 10: \u201cI have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign, and I did not have communications with the Russians.\u201d On Thursday, Sessions defended those remarks as \u201chonest and correct as I understood it at the time,\u201d though he also said he would \u201cwrite the Judiciary Committee soon \u2014 today or tomorrow \u2014 to explain this testimony for the record.\u201d\n\n-- He said he was \u201ctaken aback\u201d by Franken\u2019s question, which referred to a breaking news story at the time about contacts between Trump surrogates and Russians. \u201cIt struck me very hard, and that\u2019s what I focused my answer on,\u201d he said. \u201cIn retrospect, I should have slowed down and said I did meet one Russian official a couple times, and that would be the ambassador.\u201d\n\n-- A CASE OF REVERSE AMNESIA: \u201cA Justice Department official said Wednesday of the September meeting: \u2018There\u2019s just not strong recollection of what was said.\u2019 On Thursday, though, Sessions outlined fairly extensive details of the encounter, which included two senior Sessions staffers. He said he talked with the ambassador about a trip he made to Russia in 1991, terrorism and Ukraine \u2014 a major policy issue, given Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and the imposition of U.S. and European Union sanctions on Russia for its actions. At one point, Sessions said, \u2018it got to be a little bit of a testy conversation.\u2019 He said the ambassador invited him to lunch, but he did not accept. \u2018Most of these ambassadors are pretty gossipy, and they like to \u2014 this was in the campaign season, but I don\u2019t recall any specific political discussions,\u2019 Sessions said.\u201d (The full transcript of the presser is here.)\n\n-- At the news conference, Sessions once again maintained that he did not meet with Kislyak as a Trump supporter, but rather in his capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Service Committee.\n\nBut we've now confirmed that no one else on the committee met with the ambassador in 2016:\n\nWe reached all 26 members of the 2016 Armed Services Committee to see who met with Russian envoy Kislyak in 2016. Sessions was the only one. \u2014 Adam Entous (@adamentous) March 2, 2017\n\n-- Also: \"Sessions Used Political Funds for Republican Convention Travel,\u201d the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Paul Sonne notes: \u201cThe Trump administration says Sessions was acting as a then-U.S. senator when he talked to Russia\u2019s ambassador at an event during last year\u2019s Republican National Convention in Cleveland, but Mr. Sessions paid for convention travel expenses out of his own political funds and he spoke about [Trump\u2019s] campaign at the event.\u2026 Mr. Sessions made comments related to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign at a Heritage Foundation event during the Republican convention in July, when he met with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak.\u2026 Mr. Sessions denied that he misled lawmakers during his confirmation hearing, calling the allegation \u2018totally false\u2019.\u2026 At the time Mr. Sessions met the Russian ambassador at the convention, he had been serving as chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s National Security Advisory Committee for more than four months.\u201d\n\nJared Kushner and Michael Flynn listen during Trump's news conference on Feb. 13. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)\n\nMORE UNDISCLOSED CONTACTS WITH THE RUSSIANS:\n\n-- White House officials acknowledged yesterday that Jared Kushner joined ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn during a private meeting with the Russian envoy at Trump Tower in December. \u201cThey generally discussed the relationship and it made sense to establish a line of communication,\u201d spokeswoman Hope Hicks said on Thursday. \u201cIt is common and not improper for transition officials to meet with foreign officials. But all meetings between Trump associates and Russians are now significant as the F.B.I. investigates Russian interference in the American election and whether anyone close to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign was involved,\u201d the New York Times explains. \u201cThe meeting in December came at a crucial time.\u2026 What is now becoming clear is that the incoming Trump administration was simultaneously striking a conciliatory pose toward Moscow in a series of meetings and phone calls involving Mr. Kislyak.\u201d\n\n-- Donald Trump Jr. was likely paid a minimum of $50,000 for an appearance late last year before a French think tank whose founder and wife are allied with Russian government efforts to end the Syrian war. The Wall Street Journal reports: \u201cDonald Trump Jr. addressed a dinner on Oct. 11 at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, hosted by the Center of Political and Foreign Affairs. Its president, Fabien Baussart, and his Syrian-born wife, Randa Kassis, have cooperated with Russia in its drive to end the Syrian civil war.\u2026 In December, Mr. Baussart formally nominated Russian President Vladimir Putin for the Nobel Peace Prize. The meeting in October represents one in a string of contacts over the past year between members of the president\u2019s inner circle and individuals connected to Moscow.\u2026The existence of a financial connection between the younger Trump and an entity associated with the Kremlin would likely add to questions involving Mr. Trump\u2019s administration and Russia, following a campaign in which he was loath to criticize Russia\u2019s leader and repeatedly called for better ties to Moscow.\u201d\n\n-- Sessions was also not the only Trump adviser to huddle with the Russian ambassador during the RNC. USA Today\u2019s Steve Reilly reports: \u201cAt least two more members of the Trump campaign\u2019s national security officials also spoke with Kislyak at the event.\u2026 It's unknown what the Trump campaign officials who spoke with the ambassador \u2014 J.D. Gordon and Carter Page \u2014 discussed with him. However, the newly-revealed communications further contradict months of repeated denials by Trump officials that his campaign had contact with officials representing the Russian government. \u2018I\u2019d consider it an informal conversation just like my interactions with dozens of other ambassadors and senior diplomats in Cleveland,\u2019 Gordon said. Page, another member of the Trump campaign\u2019s national security advisory committee who also spoke with Kislyak in Cleveland, cited \u2018confidentiality rules\u2019 and said he had no \u2018substantive discussions\u2019 with him.\n\n-- Flashback: The RNC, at the behest of Trump officials, watered down the platform on Ukraine to move closer to Russia\u2019s position.\n\n-- Of note: The Russian ambassador did not go to the Democratic convention.\n\nSESSIONS RETAINS TRUMP'S SUPPORT:\n\n-- He will be a buffer for Sessions because they formed an early and nearly indestructible bond. From Matt Zapotosky, Sari Horwitz and Robert Costa: \u201cSessions was the first senator to endorse Trump at a time when few Republican lawmakers supported the candidate. His early and fierce loyalty \u2014 and his ability to translate Trump\u2019s nationalist instincts into policy \u2014 helped him forge a bond with the president, and he now enjoys access whenever he wants it, a privilege that few get, an official said. Two of Sessions\u2019s former Senate advisers \u2014 Stephen Miller and Rick Dearborn \u2014 hold key White House roles \u2026. [and] the attorney general also is friendly with [Steve Bannon] \u2026 who promoted Sessions for years on the Breitbart website.\u201d\n\n-- The president defended his AG in a series of late-night tweets:\n\nJeff Sessions is an honest man. He did not say anything wrong. He could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2017\n\n...intentional. This whole narrative is a way of saving face for Democrats losing an election that everyone thought they were supposed..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2017\n\n...to win. The Democrats are overplaying their hand. They lost the election, and now they have lost their grip on reality. The real story... \u2014 Donald J.

Schumer (D-N.Y.) said: \u201cAttorney General Sessions is right to recuse himself, but the fact is that he should have done so the moment he was sworn in.\u201d\n\n-- The House Intelligence Committee Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff, has accused FBI Director James Comey of withholding \u201ccrucial information\u201d about its probe into Russian interference in the election, warning that lawmakers may have to subpoena the FBI. Politico reports: \u201cI would say at this point we know less than a fraction of what the FBI knows,\u201d the California lawmaker told reporters after a briefing with Comey. He went on to describe the House panel\u2019s investigation as \u201camong the most serious that we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d but argued it can\u2019t thoroughly do its job if the DOJ or FBI \u201cis unwilling to tell us what indeed they looked at, what leads they have followed, where they have found substance \u2026\u201d He continued: \u201cI appreciate we had a long briefing and testimony from the director today, but in order for us to do our investigation \u2026 we\u2019re gonna need the FBI to fully cooperate \u2026 At this point, the director was not willing to do that.\u201d\n\n-- History lesson: Ten of Sessions\u2019 83 predecessors as attorney general lasted less than one year in the job. Only three of the 10 were the first appointment to the office of a presidential administration. If Sessions makes it until April 25th, he will avoid to avoid breaking the record for shortest tenure. (Smart Politics)\n\nGET TO KNOW SERGEY KISLYAK:\n\n-- Who is the man at the center of nearly every major story embroiling the Trump administration? Anne Gearan reports: \u201cHe is quiet, careful, rumpled and portly. He is a fierce defender of Russia\u2019s international prestige who \u2026 is not considered especially close to [Putin]. [Still], for Kislyak to have sought contacts with [Michael Flynn and Jeff Sessions] in 2016 when the latter was a U.S. senator should come as no surprise.\"\n\nKislyak prides himself on proximity: \u201cMost of the ambassador\u2019s outreach efforts focus on the executive branch, as is the custom for Russian diplomats whose political system back home is top-down. Lawmakers are often reluctant to meet with senior Russian officials independently because diplomacy and intelligence gathering tend to blur for Moscow\u2019s representatives in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of the ambassador\u2019s outreach efforts focus on the executive branch, as is the custom for Russian diplomats whose political system back home is top-down. Lawmakers are often reluctant to meet with senior Russian officials independently because diplomacy and intelligence gathering tend to blur for Moscow\u2019s representatives in the United States.\u201d It is not clear how much Kislyak knew about Russia\u2019s alleged effort to influence the U.S. presidential election \u201calthough it is likely that he was at least aware of it,\u201d said former CIA head of Russian operations Steven Hall. \u201cIn the case of Sessions, who was considered a top prospect for a Cabinet job when Kislyak visited him in his Senate office in September, Kislyak would have wanted to know: How reasonable is he from a Russia perspective? Hall said.\u201d\n\n\u201calthough it is likely that he was at least aware of it,\u201d said former CIA head of Russian operations Steven Hall. \u201cIn the case of Sessions, who was considered a top prospect for a Cabinet job when Kislyak visited him in his Senate office in September, Kislyak would have wanted to know: How reasonable is he from a Russia perspective? Hall said.\u201d Opinions differ on whether Kislyak is a spy in the \"American sense\" of the word: \u201c'For them it\u2019s much grayer,' Hall said of the Russian view of the difference between a diplomat and spy. 'I would say [Kislyak] is most definitely both. In the Russian system, it\u2019s simply assumed that they\u2019re all collecting and doing whatever they can either covertly or overtly.'\"\n\n-- A New York Times anecdote highlights Kislyak\u2019s influence: \u201cHe hosted a dazzling dinner in his three-story, Beaux-Arts mansion four blocks north of the White House to toast Michael A. McFaul just weeks before he took up his post as the American envoy to Russia. It was, Mr. McFaul recalled, an \u2018over-the-top, extraordinary dinner,\u2019 including five courses of Russian fusion cuisine for 50 seated guests who shared one main characteristic: They were government officials intimately involved in formulating Russia policy for the Obama administration. \u2026 [Kislyak] has interacted with American officials for decades and been a fixture on the Washington scene for the past nine years, jowly and cordial with an easy smile and fluent if accented English, yet a pugnacity in advocating Russia\u2019s assertive policies. \u2018I admired the fact that he was trying to reach deep into our government to cultivate relations with all kinds of people,\u2019 Mr. McFaul said. \u2018The way he went about entertaining, but always with a political objective.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Politico\u2019s Michael Crowley calls him \u201cWashington's most dangerous diplomat.\u201d From his piece:\n\nTrump shakes hands with H.R. McMaster in Palm Beach on Feb. 20. (Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nPERSONNEL IS POLICY:\n\n-- National security adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster was investigated by the Army in 2015 and admonished for mishandling a case involving two junior officers accused of sexual assault. Craig Whitlock reports: \u201cThe case dates to 2013, when McMaster served as commanding general of Fort Benning, Ga., home of the Ranger School. McMaster violated Army regulations by permitting [two lieutenants to attend] \u2026 even though they were under criminal investigation. \u2026 Both had been athletes on the school\u2019s rugby team, which was temporarily disbanded that spring after players were caught circulating sexually degrading emails about women. Investigators examining the rugby team\u2019s conduct interviewed a female cadet who said she had been groped on several occasions by two of the players \u2026 Unidentified congressional officials learned in 2014 that the former rugby players had been improperly allowed to go to Ranger School and asked the Army to investigate, which led to the inspector general\u2019s probe of McMaster.\u201d In late 2014, the inspector general concluded McMaster had violated Army regulations, adding that \u201cappropriate action\u201d had since been taken. (McMaster received a light rebuke for his actions, known as a \u201cmemorandum of concern.\u201d) \u201cWe consider this matter closed,\u201d a spokeswoman said.\n\nRex Tillerson meets with International Atomic Energy Agency Director Yukiya Amano at the State Department yesterday. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nSTATE HAS BEEN SIDELINED:\n\n-- \u201cTop Trump Advisers Are Split on Paris Agreement on Climate Change,\u201d by the New York Times\u2019s Coral Davenport: \u201cStephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s senior adviser, is pressing the president to officially pull the United States from the landmark accord, according to energy and government officials with knowledge of the debate. But, they say, he is clashing with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka, who fear the move could have broad and damaging diplomatic ramifications. \u2026 Next week, Mr. Trump plans to sign an executive order directing (Scott) Pruitt to start the lengthy legal process of unwinding Mr. Obama\u2019s E.P.A. regulations for cutting greenhouse pollution from coal-fired power plants. Those regulations are the linchpin of the last administration\u2019s program to meet the nation\u2019s obligations to reduce climate emissions under the Paris agreement. While the president cannot, as Mr. Trump suggested, unilaterally undo a 194-nation accord that has already been legally ratified, he could initiate the four-year process to withdraw the world\u2019s largest economy and second-largest climate polluter from the first worldwide deal to tackle global warming.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cAnxiety and listless days as a foreign-policy bureaucracy confronts the possibility of radical change,\u201d by The Atlantic's Julia Ioffe: \u201cWith the State Department demonstratively shut out of meetings with foreign leaders, key State posts left unfilled, and the White House not soliciting many department staffers for their policy advice, there is little left to do. \u2026 The seeming hostility from the White House, the decades of American foreign-policy tradition being turned on its head, and the days of listlessness are taking a toll on people who are used to channeling their ambition and idealism into the detail-oriented, highly regimented [work] \u2026 Without it, anxiety has spiked.\u201d\n\n\u201cI used to love my job,\u201d said one staffer at State. \u201cNow, it feels like coming to the hospital to take care of a terminally ill family member. You come in every day, you bring flowers, you brush their hair, paint their nails, even though you know there\u2019s no point. But you do it out of love.\u201d\n\nYou come in every day, you bring flowers, you brush their hair, paint their nails, even though you know there\u2019s no point. But you do it out of love.\u201d \u201c\u2018If I left before 10 p.m., that was a good day,\u2019 (another unnamed staffer) said of the old days, which used to start at 6:30 in the morning. \u2018Now, I come in at 9, 9:15, and leave by 5:30.\u2019 \u2026 Over a long impromptu lunch one afternoon\u2014\u2018I can meet tomorrow or today, whenever! Do you want to meet right now?\u2019\u2014the staffer told me she too has trouble sleeping now, kept awake by her worries about her job and America\u2019s fading role in the world.\u201d\n\n-- The steady departure of senior officials at the State Department is continuing, as two assistant secretaries of state are stepping down next week. From Carol Morello: \u201cThe impending losses of Daniel Russel, assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific affairs, and Linda Thomas-Greenfield, assistant secretary of African affairs, leave only a handful of career diplomats who were holdovers from the Obama administration among the cadre of senior State Department officials. Most of the assistant and undersecretaries were political appointees. Following tradition, they all offered their resignations after the election. In the past, many stayed on until a successor was named. The Trump administration accepted all their resignations, however, and the White House and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have not named any replacements. Instead, their jobs are being done by deputies filling in temporarily, contributing to a sense of drift in Foggy Bottom.\u201d\n\n-- Marco Rubio chided Tillerson for declining to be involved in in the public release of the State Department\u2019s annual human rights report, slated for release today. Politico reports: \u201cThe report unveiling almost always includes a press event and remarks by the secretary of state, or, in rare cases, another high-ranking department official. The secretary's presence is intended to send a signal about the importance of human rights to the United States' diplomatic agenda. But in recent days, sources have reportedly been told Tillerson may not follow tradition this year. The reports come as the Trump officials also weigh whether to have the U.S. pull out of the U.N. Human Rights Council \u2013 the latest in a string of discussions that have prompted alarm among rights activists.\"\n\n-- Jim Mattis is encountering pushback from White House officials as he attempts to tap former U.S. ambassador to Egypt, Anne Patterson, as undersecretary of defense for policy. Politico\u2019s Eliana Johnson reports: \u201cThe skirmish surrounding Patterson\u2019s nomination is the latest in a series of personnel battles that have played out between Mattis and the White House, with each side rejecting the names offered up by the other while the Pentagon remains empty. The White House has yet to nominate a single undersecretary or deputy secretary to the Defense Department, while Work, Mattis\u2019s deputy, is an Obama administration holdover who only agreed to stay on until the secretary taps a deputy of his own.\n\nPaul Ryan and Mitch McConnell meet with reporters outside the White House following their Monday meeting with President Trump. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nREPUBLICANS DIVIDED ON OBAMACARE REPEAL:\n\n-- Paul Ryan is feeling confident about repeal-and-replace. Mitch McConnell, not so much. Paul Kane looks at the House-Senate dynamic: \u201cWith each passing day, [the Speaker] gets more confident that his troops are falling in line and that they will soon pass legislation repealing the Affordable Care Act. \u2018I am perfectly confident that when it\u2019s all said and done, we are going to unify,\u2019 Ryan told reporters \u2026 Yet over in the Senate, [the majority leader] is much more circumspect. \u2018The goal is for the administration, the House and the Senate to be in the same place,\u2019 McConnell [said] \u2018We\u2019re not there yet.\u2019 This is the way it used to work, back before the rabble-rousing tea party turned Republican politics upside down. Whether Republicans or Democrats were running Congress, the biggest hurdle for many decades was always getting legislation through the cumbersome rules of the Senate \u2026 For the past six years, however, that dynamic has been turned on its head. Instead, the House Republican Conference has functioned somewhere between a junior high school class with a substitute teacher and a failed nation state \u2026 Now, however, the tide might be shifting back to its normal course.\u201d\n\n-- An array of conservative lawmakers and activists are demanding a swift \u201cfull repeal\u201d of the ACA that is more aggressive than some Republican lawmakers are comfortable with \u2013 raising questions about whether Trump and the GOP are careening towards gridlock. David Weigel, Sean Sullivan and Mike DeBonis report: \u201cThe current proposal, floated privately this week by House Republicans, repeals portions of the ACA but, because of pressure from constituents who depend on the law, leaves some elements intact that conservatives are not happy about. [But] for the many Republicans who were elected during Obama\u2019s presidency with a mandate to block his agenda, obstruction comes much more naturally than governance. The effort to repeal the ACA is the first major test of whether they can harness the energy they used to oppose the law to actually undo it \u2014 or whether ideological divisions will sink the effort.\u201d Meanwhile, three conservative senators known for bucking GOP leadership during Obama\u2019s presidency \u2014 Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Mike Lee \u2014 have raised the possibility of doing the same against Trump.\n\n-- Rand, the Kentucky senator, held an impromptu \u201cprotest\u201d-turned-news-conference outside a nondescript Capitol meeting room where House Republicans were gathered to discuss their plans for a possible Affordable Care Act replacement bill. From David Weigel: \u201c[Paul], who has pledged to oppose any bill that does not fully do away with the ACA and its insurance subsidies, learned late Thursday morning that committee members were talking about the bill in H157, a room on the Capitol\u2019s first floor. \u2018I have been told that the House Obamacare bill is under lock and key, in a secure location, and not available for me or the public to view,\u2019 he tweeted. According to House Republican staff, this wasn\u2019t the whole story. The bill, which has been workshopped and previewed in private meeting, is not ready yet. But at noon, a dozen reporters were already staking out the room \u2014 which was being guarded by Capitol Police officers \u2014 Paul and several members of his staff strolled up, toting a copier just in case the senator got his hands on the bill.\u201d\n\n-- Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), the co-sponsor of legislation that would replace most of the Affordable Care Act by allowing states to keep portions of it, says he hears \u201crepeal\u201d differently than some Republicans. David Weigel: In a scrum with reporters, Cassidy said that \u2018Obamacare\u2019 was not really a synonym for the Affordable Care Act. For many voters, he said, \u2018Obamacare\u2019 meant the parts of the law that Republicans would get rid of, and the Affordable Care Act was the provisions, such as continued coverage for people with preexisting conditions, that Republicans intended to keep. \u2018The Affordable Care Act is, if you will, a different animal, and Obamacare is a different subset of it,\u201d Cassidy said. \u2018Complete repeal is not what President Trump ran on.\u2019\u201d\n\nLongtime dishwasher Ali Sonko poses in Copenhagen's world-class Noma restaurant. He recently got a pretty sweet raise... (EPA/Asger Ladefoged)\n\nWAPO HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n-- Feel-good story of the day --> A Copenhagen dishwasher has become a partner in one of the most preeminent restaurants in the world. From Tim Carman: \u201cIn the military-style hierarchy of U.S. restaurant kitchens, a dishwasher ranks near the bottom, even if chefs, given half a chance, will loudly sing a good pot-scrubber\u2019s praises. But over in Copenhagen, Rene Redzepi, the chef and co-owner of Noma, did something extraordinary last week for the restaurant\u2019s longtime dishwasher: He made Ali Sonko a partner in the Danish gastronomic temple that regularly ranks among the world\u2019s best.\u201d Sonko \u2014 along with two other veterans -- were collectively given 10 percent of the multi-million holding company overseeing Noma, which boasts two Michelin stars. They\u2019re now set for life, but Redzepi insists it\u2019s about more than the unexpected windfall. 'It\u2019s about that you\u2019re part of something,' he said. 'I\u2019m so happy thinking that these guys are going to be with us going forward.' This isn\u2019t the first time Sonko made headlines: When the Noma crew traveled to London to pick up its trophy after netting a spot in the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants, Sonko could not secure a British visa to attend the ceremony. Still, the team made sure he was there in spirit: They wore T-shirts bearing the dishwasher\u2019s face.\"\n\n-- For years, ISIS has been dumping bodies in a cavernous desert sinkhole just miles from the airport in Mosul, making the site one of horrific legend \u2013 a 100-foot hole where victims, both alive and dead, were sent to their gruesome deaths. Iraqi Loveday Morris and Mustafa Salim report: \u201cSoon after the group took control of the Iraqi city more than 2\u00bd years ago \u2026 victims were made to line up at the edge of the hole and were shot before being kicked inside, while others were tossed in alive, residents said. Sometimes bodies were just trucked in for dumping. But with communications limited and locals too fearful to speak out publicly, it was only after Iraqi forces retook the area last month \u2026. that the scale of the killings at the site began to emerge. Based on anecdotal evidence, Iraqi officials say thousands may have perished there in recent years. It may be years more, though, before the mass grave gives up its secrets. No one knows the depth of the hole under the water at the bottom. The militants have filled it and booby-trapped it with explosives, making excavation particularly complex.\n\nA FRIDAY BONUS:\n\n-- George W. Bush appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show yesterday. While he was somewhat disinclined to dance (a longtime Ellen tradition), he poked fun at himself on several occasions \u2013 including a now meme-inspiring poncho incident from Trump\u2019s inauguration. \"The poncho was a problem. Had you put one on?\" DeGeneres asked. \"Is that the first time?\" Bush chuckled: \u201cYeah, it looks like it!\"\n\nHe told a revealing story about how Vladimir Putin dissed Barney, his beloved Scottish Terrier. USA Today\u2019s Erin Jensen: \u201cBush explained the Russian president was not impressed after meeting [Barney] \u2026 \u2018[Putin] kind of dissed him,\u2019 Bush explained. \u2018He looked at him like, 'You think that\u2019s a dog?' A year later Putin said, \u201cWould you like to meet my dog?\u201d [Laura] and I were with Putin in this dacha outside of Moscow \u2026 and out comes a giant hound kind of loping across the yard, and Putin looks at me and says, \u2018Bigger, stronger, and faster than Barney.\u2019 Moral of the story, the 43rd president explained: 'He\u2019s got a chip on his shoulder.' He added, 'I had a contentious relationship with him and I think whoever the president is, is going to find out that Putin will push and push and push until somebody stands up to him.'\"\n\n-- Alec Baldwin said there\u2019s a possibility he\u2019ll show up to the White House Correspondent\u2019s dinner as Trump. Helena Andrews-Dyer: \u201cIt\u2019s March, and there\u2019s still no word on which comedian will headline the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association\u2019s annual dinner. Usually the organization announces its big-name entertainer months ahead of the spring gala \u2026 But this year is a tad unusual. The silence, of course, has only fanned the flames engulfing the rumor mill. Alec Baldwin, whose wildly popular impersonation of Trump on \u2018SNL\u2019 is right up there with former player Will Ferrell\u2019s George W. Bush, unsurprisingly is the crowd favorite. During a recent sit-down with late night host Jimmy Kimmel, Baldwin said he wasn\u2019t \u2018not lobbying\u2019 for the potential gig. Huh? \u2018Well, I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m not lobbying,\u2019 Baldwin replied, adding that there was a lot of competition on the Internet about who delivers the best Trump. Kimmel had one good point for the Baldwin column. \u2018It should be whoever the president hates seeing do it the most, and that\u2019s undoubtedly you,\u2019 he said.\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nTrump hawked a book this morning from this guy:\n\nNick Adams new book, Green Card Warrior, is a must read.

Cloud: \u201cWorking from a 24th-floor office in Manhattan\u2019s Trump Tower, Felix Sater spent years trying to line up lucrative deals in the U.S., Russia and elsewhere in Europe with [Trump\u2019s] real estate organization. For much of that time, according to court records and U.S. officials, Sater also worked as a confidential informant for the FBI, and \u2014 he says \u2014 U.S. intelligence. \u2018I was building Trump Towers by day and hunting Bin Laden by night,\u2019 [he said] \u2026 As managing director of [a real estate development group] \u2026 the Russian-born businessman met Trump in 2003, court records show, when Trump was looking to expand his business and branding organization around the globe. Trump has denied they were close, but Sater had access to Trump\u2019s inner circle as recently as this year.\n\n\"Although few projects were built, Sater worked on hotel and condominium deals with the Trump Organization through 2010 in New York, Florida, Arizona, London, Moscow and elsewhere even as he secretly helped the FBI infiltrate and take down organized crime figures. \u2026 In January, Sater and [Trump attorney Michael Cohen] met in a New York hotel with a Ukrainian lawmaker who asked them to bring the White House a pro-Russian peace deal for Ukraine. 'I was only trying to stop a war,' Sater said of his role linking [lawmaker Andrei Artemenko] with Cohen.\u201d The Times had quoted Cohen as saying he gave the envelope containing the proposal to ousted Trump adviser Michael Flynn -- but now he has reversed course. While Sater admits the meeting took place, he \u201cemphatically denies\u201d discussing this topic or delivering any documents to the White House and or/Flynn.\n\n-- Vanity Fair, \u201cWhy the alt-left is a problem, too,\u201d by James Wolcott: \u201cDisillusionment with Obama\u2019s presidency, loathing of Hillary Clinton, disgust with \u2018identity politics,\u2019 and a craving for a climactic reckoning that will clear the stage for a bold tomorrow have created a kinship between the \u2018alt-right\u2019 and an alt-left. They\u2019re not kissin\u2019 cousins, but they caterwaul some of the same tunes in different keys. \u2026 The left\u2019s romance with revolution has always been a reality-blinder, this thermodynamic belief that things need to get bad beyond the breaking point so that people will take the vape pens out of their mouths, rise up, and storm the Bastille. But the history of non-democracies and authoritarian personality cults shows that things can stay bad and get worse for a long time, leaving unhealable wounds. Mao\u2019s China, for example.

It was actually a Sizzler training certificate,\u201d from Sarah Larimer: \u201cThe information that was posted on the Iowa Senate Republican\u2019s website used to suggest that Mark Chelgren, a [Republican] state lawmaker, held a business degree. But that wasn\u2019t exactly the case, according to NBC News and other media outlets, which this week reported that Chelgren instead held a certificate for a training program for the chain restaurant Sizzler. Still, Chelgren \u2026 said that he didn\u2019t mean to mislead people. According to an image posted by the network, information on the site had previously indicated that Chelgren had a degree in business management from Forbco Management school. \u2026 Chelgren made headlines this month [after authoring proposed legislation] \u2026 that seeks to \u2018require partisan balance\u2019 of faculty members who work at higher-ed institutions that are governed by the Iowa Board of Regents, according to its text.\u201d HOT ON THE RIGHT: \u201cJudge Under Investigation for Allegedly Helping Illegal Immigrant Escape ICE Through Her Private Entrance,\u201d from the Washington Free Beacon: \u201cA judge in Multnomah County, Oregon is under investigation for allegedly helping an illegal immigrant evade federal authorities.
