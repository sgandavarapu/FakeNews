Cohn was a legendary New York fixer, a ruthless lawyer in the hunt for new clients.

He returned from a weekend at his Palm Beach club. (Erik S. Lesser/EPA)\n\nWith Breanne Deppisch\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: It is easy to pooh-pooh Donald Trump\u2019s predawn Saturday tweetstorm \u2014 accusing Barack Obama of the worst political crimes since Watergate while offering no evidence \u2014 as an undisciplined rant from someone who has long embraced conspiracy theories.\n\nThat neither gives the president enough credit nor reflects the gravity of his unfounded accusations.\n\nIt is past time to dispense with the fiction that Trump doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. He knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. He is trying to distract us. And, at least this weekend, he succeeded.\n\nTrump beelined for the Oval Office after arriving at the White House last night. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)\n\n-- The country\u2019s chief law enforcement officer made a false statement to Congress, while under oath, about his contacts with one of this nation\u2019s biggest adversaries. (Legal experts, including Republicans, note that others have been prosecuted for less.) When he got busted, Attorney General Jeff Sessions initially claimed through a spokeswoman that he couldn\u2019t recall specifics of what had been said during his undisclosed sit-down with the Russian ambassador, except that it wasn\u2019t political in nature. Then, with his job on the line, he miraculously remembered supposedly exculpatory details.\n\nThis is a big dang deal, no matter how hard Sessions tries to spin it. It\u2019s such a big deal that, after weeks of refusing to do so and with the president publicly urging him not to, the AG agreed to recuse himself from any investigations related to the 2016 campaign.\n\nLast Thursday, Sessions said at his press conference that he would write the Judiciary Committee \u201ctoday or tomorrow\u201d to clarify his misleading testimony. It\u2019s now been four days, and he has yet to formally clean things up. A spokesman said he\u2019ll submit amended testimony later today. We\u2019ll see. Either way, a delay this long only happens when one is trying to get one\u2019s ducks in a row.\n\nBut the press didn\u2019t spend this weekend talking about Sessions. He had confirmed to attend the Gridiron Dinner in Washington on Saturday night, but he skipped it and flew to Florida to be with Trump. The Sunday shows did not dwell on debates over the AG\u2019s duplicity. Instead, everyone talked about whether Obama wiretapped Trump Tower last October.\n\nAnd Trump was happy as a clam about that. A White House official told The Post that the president was in a brighter mood on Sunday morning than he was on Saturday because he was pleased that his allegations against Obama were the dominant story on cable and led the newspapers.\n\nThe president knows the media cannot ignore him when he says something so inflammatory, and he believes there will be no real consequences for him if it turns out that everything he said was nonsense. After all, there haven\u2019t been up until now.\n\nMoreover, Trump\u2019s core supporters also got a new talking point. Whenever they\u2019re confronted with the links between Trump associates and Russia, millions of people are now going to reply that the real story is Obama\u2019s wiretapping \u2014 even if that claim is shown definitively to have no basis in reality.\n\nHOW HE DECIDED TO TWEET:\n\n-- The president was seething mad as he watched round-the-clock cable news coverage about Sessions. He was angry that the positive marks he received for his Tuesday speech to Congress, which made him jubilant, had been replaced by the Wednesday night news about Sessions. The Post\u2019s Phil Rucker, Bob Costa and Ashley Parker have a tick tock on the fury that followed, based on interviews with 17 top White House officials, members of Congress and friends of the president:\n\n\u201cInside the West Wing [on Wednesday night], Trump\u2019s top aides were furious with the defenses of Sessions offered by the Justice Department\u2019s public affairs division and felt blindsided that Sessions\u2019s aides had not consulted the White House earlier in the process\u2026.\n\nand felt blindsided that Sessions\u2019s aides had not consulted the White House earlier in the process\u2026. \u201cThe next morning, Trump exploded , according to White House officials. He headed to Newport News, Va., on Thursday for a splashy commander-in-chief moment. The president would trumpet his plan to grow military spending aboard the Navy\u2019s sophisticated new aircraft carrier. But as Trump, sporting a bomber jacket and Navy cap, rallied sailors and shipbuilders, his message was overshadowed by Sessions \u2026.\n\n, according to White House officials.

The president would trumpet his plan to grow military spending aboard the Navy\u2019s sophisticated new aircraft carrier. But as Trump, sporting a bomber jacket and Navy cap, rallied sailors and shipbuilders, \u2026. \u201cThen, a few hours after Trump had publicly defended his attorney general and said he should not recuse himself from the Russia probe, Sessions called a news conference to announce just that \u2014 amounting to a public rebuke of the president \u2026.\n\n\u2026. \u201cBack at the White House on Friday morning, Trump summoned his senior aides into the Oval Office, where he simmered with rage , according to several White House officials. He upbraided them over Sessions\u2019s decision to recuse himself , believing that Sessions had succumbed to pressure from the media and other critics instead of fighting with the full defenses of the White House\u2026\n\n, according to several White House officials. , believing that Sessions had succumbed to pressure from the media and other critics instead of fighting with the full defenses of the White House\u2026 \u201cIn a huff, Trump departed for Mar-a-Lago, taking with him only his daughter and [son-in-law] , who is a White House senior adviser.

His top two aides, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and [Stephen] Bannon, stayed behind in Washington. \u201cStories from Breitbart News, the incendiary conservative website, have been circulated at the White House\u2019s highest levels in recent days, including one story where talk-radio host Mark Levin accused the Obama administration of mounting a \u2018silent coup,\u2019 according to several officials.\u201d\n\nTHIS IS TRUMP\u2019S MODUS OPERANDI:\n\n-- Whenever he is under fire for something in a sustained way, he makes a shocking claim or provocative declaration about something else to change the subject. He is a master practitioner at the politics of distraction. These five examples might jog your memory:\n\nAfter struggling during the first GOP primary debate to explain his disparaging comments about women, he attacked Megyn Kelly . \u201cThere was \u2026 blood coming out of her wherever,\u201d he said, ensuring that the media focused on the new Trump-Kelly \u201cfeud.\u201d\n\n. \u201cThere was \u2026 blood coming out of her wherever,\u201d he said, ensuring that the media focused on the new Trump-Kelly \u201cfeud.\u201d When the 2005 Access Hollywood video came out, he brought Bill Clinton\u2019s former accusers to St. Louis as his guests to the second debate.\n\nas his guests to the second debate. In November, the morning after agreeing to settle a fraud lawsuit against Trump University for $25 million, he demanded that the cast of \u201cHamilton\u201d apologize to Mike Pence.\n\nDays after firing Michael Flynn, he held a rambling 77-minute press conference because he knew that it would get the Flynn story out of the news.\n\nbecause he knew that it would get the Flynn story out of the news. Perturbed when critics pointed out that he lost the popular vote, he claimed that 3 million to 5 million people voted illegally.\n\nRoy Cohn, Ed Kosner and Donald Trump in 1983. (Sonia Moskowitz/Getty Images)\n\nALWAYS ATTACK, NEVER APOLOGIZE\n\n-- Trump\u2019s approach to crisis management continues to be guided by the Roy Cohn playbook. \u201cThis is McCarthyism!\u201d Trump said, as he attacked Obama for supposedly wiretapping him, on Saturday. There was great irony to this. Cohn, after all, was Joe McCarthy\u2019s chief counsel on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations during the early 1950s. Two decades later, he became one of Trump\u2019s biggest mentors during a formative phase of his life.\n\n-- Cohn\u2019s creed was to always be on the attack, to counterpunch whenever punched and to never apologize. Never, ever, ever apologize. He believed that you never yield an inch, even if you\u2019re in the wrong, because your opponents will take a mile.\n\n-- \u201cThe man who showed Trump how to exploit power and instill fear\u201d is how The Post\u2019s Robert O'Harrow Jr. and Shawn Boburg described him in a story last June: \u201cTrump was a brash scion of a real estate empire, a young developer anxious to leave his mark on New York. Cohn was a legendary New York fixer, a ruthless lawyer in the hunt for new clients. They came together by chance one night at Le Club, a hangout for Manhattan\u2019s rich and famous. Trump introduced himself to Cohn, who was sitting at a nearby table, and sought advice: How should he and his father respond to Justice Department allegations that their company had systematically discriminated against black people seeking housing? \u2018My view is tell them to go to hell,\u2019 Cohn said, \u2018and fight the thing in court.\u2019 It was October 1973 and the start of one of the most influential relationships of Trump\u2019s career.\u201d\n\nCohn represented the Trumps throughout their protracted legal fight with DOJ. In 1973, looking to change the storyline, Cohn had a news conference to announce that Donald and Fred were countersuing the federal government for $100 million. He claimed the government was trying to force \u201csubservience to the Welfare Department.\u201d Ultimately, the Trumps settled without admitting guilt, which allowed them to declare victory.\n\n-- Trump was even quoted in The Post\u2019s 1986 obituary of Cohn, who died of complications from AIDS. \"If you need someone to get vicious toward an opponent, you get Roy,\u201d he said.\n\n-- This same approach is on display when Trump tries to repurpose the very attacks being leveled against him against his accusers. On Friday, he literally called for investigations into Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi for meetings they had with the Russian ambassador. It\u2019s a slightly more adult version of, \u201cI know what you are, but what am I?\u201d\n\n-- In Politico Magazine last April, Michael Kruse documented the many ways that Cohn was more than just Trump\u2019s lawyer: \u201cOver a 13-year-period, Cohn brought his say-anything, win-at-all-costs style to all of Trump\u2019s most notable \u2026 deals. Interviews with people who knew both men at the time say the relationship ran deeper than that \u2014 that Cohn\u2019s philosophy shaped the real estate mogul\u2019s worldview and the belligerent public persona visible in Trump\u2019s campaign. \u2026 He brokered the gargantuan tax abatements and the mob-tied concrete work that made the Grand Hyatt hotel and Trump Tower projects. He wrote the cold-hearted prenuptial agreement before the first of his three marriages and filed the headline-generating antitrust suit against the National Football League. \u2026 \u2018He considered Cohn a mentor,\u2019 Mike Gentile, the lead prosecutor who got Cohn disbarred for fraud and deceit not long before he died, said in a recent interview.\u201d\n\n-- Another reason the relationship with Cohn mattered: Roger Stone, his longtime political consigliere, first met Trump through Cohn. Stone seemed to have inside knowledge on the WikiLeaks document releases during the campaign\u2026.\n\n-- Not much has changed in how Trump does damage control over the past four decades, but one big thing is different: He now controls the very Justice Department that he and Cohn once countersued\u2026.\n\nTrump salutes on the tarmac after disembarking Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base yesterday. (Alex Brandon/AP)\n\nBUT, BUT, BUT:\n\n-- Here\u2019s the rub: Trump is not as cunning as he thinks. He\u2019s playing checkers, not chess. (Or maybe it\u2019s Connect Four.) While he\u2019s proven adept at manipulating the New York tabloid world for decades, as the first president in American history with no prior political or military experience, he\u2019s a rookie at playing the inside game. And it is coming back to haunt him. Bigly.\n\nCohn\u2019s chapter in Washington didn\u2019t end well. He overreached with his witch hunt, prompting Dwight Eisenhower to come after him. After being bested in the 1954 Army-McCarthy hearings, he escaped to New York. McCarthy died of alcoholism after his Republican colleagues in the Senate voted to censure him.\n\nSIX MAJOR WAYS THAT TRUMP\u2019S WIRETAPPING CLAIMS COULD BACKFIRE:\n\n1. Turning the FBI director against him:\n\nJames B. Comey asked the Justice Department this weekend to issue a statement refuting Trump\u2019s claim that Obama ordered a wiretap, but the department did not do so. \u201cThe revelation underscores the fraught nature of the FBI\u2019s high-profile investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election,\u201d Abby Phillip and Ellen Nakashima note. \u201cA key question fueling that inquiry is whether Trump associates colluded with Russian officials to help Trump win. \u2026 It is not clear why Comey \u2026 did not himself issue a statement to refute Trump\u2019s claims.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Comey's request is a remarkable rebuke of a sitting president, putting the nation's top law enforcement official in the position of questioning Mr. Trump's truthfulness,\u201d notes the New York Times, which first reported the news. \u201cThe confrontation between the two is the most serious consequence of Mr. Trump's weekend Twitter outburst, and it underscores the dangers of what the president and his aides have unleashed by accusing the former president of a conspiracy\u2026.\u201d\n\nWhite House counsel Don McGahn (Albin Lohr-Jones/Pool via Bloomberg)\n\n2. Prodding the White House counsel to take risks he otherwise would not:\n\nTrump\u2019s tweets caught his top aides by surprise, and they spent Saturday trying to figure out how to respond and looking for any backup.\n\nA senior White House official told The New York Times on Saturday that Donald McGahn was working to secure access to what he believed to be an order issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court authorizing some form of surveillance related to Trump and his associates. \u201cThe official offered no evidence to support the notion that such an order exists,\u201d Michael D. Shear and Michael S. Schmidt reported. \u201cIt would be a highly unusual breach of the Justice Department\u2019s traditional independence on law enforcement matters for the White House to order it to turn over such an investigative document. Any request for information from a top White House official about a continuing investigation would be a stunning departure from protocols intended to insulate the F.B.I. from political pressure. It would be even more surprising for the White House to seek information about a case directly involving the president or his advisers.\u201d After the Times story blew up, another administration official walked back the earlier statements.\n\nTrump walks to Marine One on the South Lawn with his grandchildren last Friday. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\n3. Trump has become the boy who cried wolf:\n\nThe president\u2019s claims about Obama wiretapping were so indefensible that even his aides would not defend them directly, Aaron Blake notes, pointing to tweets from press secretary Sean Spicer and a Sunday show appearance by deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. \u201cLet's look into this,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIf this happened, if this is accurate, this is the biggest overreach and the biggest scandal.\u201d Trump, of course, didn\u2019t equivocate; he stated it as fact.\n\nTrump has a very long history of making very serious allegations with no facts to back them up. Beyond his multi-year quest to prove Obama was not born in the United States, the president has said that his predecessor did not really attend Columbia University, insinuated last year that Obama bribed the New York attorney general to investigate Trump University and called him \u201cthe founder of ISIS.\u201d\n\nAmong the other fallacious claims that Trump made during the campaign which he never offered any substantiation for:\n\nThe IRS might be auditing his tax returns \u201cbecause of the fact that I'm a strong Christian.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that Ted Cruz\u2019s father was somehow involved with Lee Harvey Oswald.\n\nHe said there\u2019s something \"very fishy\" about Vince Foster's death.\n\nHe trafficked in rumors that Antonin Scalia may have been a victim of foul play. \u201cThey say they found a pillow on his face,\u201d Trump said in one radio interview, \u201cwhich is a pretty unusual place to find a pillow.\u201d\n\nHe said vaccines may cause childhood autism.\n\nHe maintained that thousands of Muslims in New Jersey celebrated the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nHe insisted that a man who charged the security barricades at one of his rallies in Ohio was a member of the Islamic State. He based this false statement on a hoax Internet video he and his staff saw online.\n\nWhat happens in the aftermath of a terrorist attack, during a natural disaster or amid an economic crisis? He\u2019ll desperately need the American people to trust and rally behind him, but he will have drained the reservoir of goodwill. That is when Trump\u2019s credibility gap is going to become a cataclysmic problem for his presidency and, frankly, for the country.\n\n4. Making his White House look dysfunctional:\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s presidency has veered onto a road with no centerlines or guardrails,\u201d Karen Tumulty writes in a smart analysis. \u201cTrump\u2019s response also has deepened doubts about his own judgment, not just in the face of the first crisis to confront his young presidency but in dealing with the challenges that lie ahead for the chief executive of the world\u2019s most powerful nation. \u2026 The voice of a U.S. commander in chief carries much greater weight than that of just about anyone else on the planet. Trump\u2019s detractors say the way he uses that platform has worrisome implications that go far beyond the sensation he creates on social media and his ability to dominate the news. \u2026 Nor does Trump appear to have a governing apparatus around him that can temper and channel his impulses.\u201d Two quotes:\n\n\u201cWe have as president a man who is erratic, vindictive, volatile, obsessive, a chronic liar, and prone to believe in conspiracy theories,\u201d said conservative commentator Peter Wehner, who was the top policy strategist in George W. Bush\u2019s White House. \u201cAnd you can count on the fact that there will be more to come, since when people like Donald Trump gain power they become less, not more, restrained.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the president goes off and does what he did within the last few days, of just going ahead and tweeting without checking on things, there\u2019s something wrong. There\u2019s something wrong in terms of the discipline within the White House and how you operate,\u201d said Leon Panetta, a White House chief of staff for Bill Clinton and CIA director during the Obama administration, on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nSen. Ben Sasse visits his Lincoln, Neb., office last month. (Nati Harnik/AP)\n\n5. Emboldening conservatives to call for a full investigation:\n\nMany congressional Republicans are already fatigued with having to defend Trump when he makes these kinds of claims, and the charges of illegal eavesdropping may prompt some to support something more aggressive than the ongoing probes by the House and Senate intelligence committees.\n\n\"I'm very worried that our president is suggesting that the former president's done something illegally,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said at a town hall meeting in his state on Saturday night. \"I would be very worried if, in fact, the Obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about Trump campaign activity with foreign governments. So it's my job as a United States senator to get to the bottom of this. I promise you I will.\"\n\n\"We are in the midst of a civilization-warping crisis of public trust, and the President\u2019s allegations \u2026 demand the thorough and dispassionate attention of serious patriots,\u201d said Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) in a statement. \u201cA quest for the full truth, rather than knee-jerk partisanship, must be our guide if we are going to rebuild civic trust and health.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president put that out there, and now the White House will have to answer as to exactly what he was referring to,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on \"Meet the Press.\u201d \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t make the allegation. I\u2019m not the person that went out there and said it.\u201d\n\n6. Ensuring, more broadly, that the Russia connections continue to overshadow his domestic agenda:\n\nIf they have nothing to hide, why haven\u2019t they been forthcoming? Trump and his spokeswoman categorically denied that any communication took place between the campaign and any foreign entity. \u201cIn fact, it is now clear it did happen,\u201d Rosalind Helderman notes. \u201cThe past few days have brought a growing list of confirmed communications between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials, with each new revelation adding to a cloud of suspicion that hangs over the White House.\u2026 It is unclear why the White House has consistently denied contacts with Russian officials if the meetings that took place were innocuous. As a result, the confirmations of the encounters have trickled out through a series of news stories that have proved increasingly damaging to the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nTomorrow\u2019s confirmation hearing for Rod Rosenstein to become deputy attorney general will now be must-see TV.

From Robert Barnes: \"The justices were scheduled to hear the case later this month. But after the federal government\u2019s position changed, the court said the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit should reconsider the dispute between the Gloucester County school board and 17-year-old Gavin Grimm. The 4th Circuit had relied on the federal government\u2019s guidance that school should let transgender students use the bathroom that corresponds with the student\u2019s gender identity. The Trump administration withdrew that guidance, which was issued by the Obama administration. Both the school board and Grimm\u2019s attorneys had asked the Supreme Court to let the case proceed, saying it presented a reading of the civil rights law Title IX that the court ultimately will have to settle.\"\n\nKim Jong Un visited a local school on \"tree-planting day.\" (KCNA/via Reuters)\n\nTHE WORLD IS ON FIRE:\n\n-- North Korea launched four missiles on Monday morning, firing a provocative barrage that coincided both with joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises on the southern half of the peninsula \u2014 and with the opening of the annual National People\u2019s Congress in China.

The new rollout is expected to address of the concerns raised by federal judges, and comes after both Jeff Sessions and DHS Secretary John Kelly \u2014 key players in the implementation of the order \u2014 met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Saturday. (Abby Phillip and Robert Costa)\n\n-- Expect three changes in the new order: Among other things, it\u2019s expected to exempt current visa holders \u2014 a significant departure from Trump\u2019s first order. And it removes an exception to the refugee prohibition for religious minorities \u2014 which critics said was discriminatory because it allowed only Christians into the country. And, to soothe tensions with Baghdad, the new order will not include a blanket ban on citizens from Iraq. (Matt Zapotosky)\n\n-- \u201cIt\u2019s not just deportations and the border: Trump seeks to remake the immigration system,\u201d by David Nakamura: \u201cFor half a century, U.S. immigration laws have favored family reunification, allowing immigrants who gain legal permanent residence to bring over their children, spouses, parents and siblings. Critics of the process have argued that so-called chain migration has \u2026 fostered an influx of those who are competing with native-born Americans for low-wage, low-skilled jobs. In Trump\u2019s view, a new immigration system would curtail entry to the country among foreigners who cannot \u2018support themselves financially,\u2019 although he did not define what that means. \u2026 To immigrant rights groups, Trump\u2019s talk of a merit system is code for slashing legal pathways into the country and focusing them on highly educated immigrants from advanced nations \u2014 a strategy that harks back to a 1920s backlash against a wave of immigrants who entered the country during the Second Industrial Revolution.\u201d\n\nMike Pence and Tom Price arrive at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport last week to have a \"listening session\" with small business owners. (John Minchillo/AP)\n\nGOP DIVIDED ON OBAMACARE:\n\n-- Is Tom Price being marginalized? From the Rucker, Costa and Parker story on tumult inside the White House: \u201cThe administration intends to introduce a legislative plan later in the week to repeal and replace Obama\u2019s health-care law. \u2026 The rest of Trump\u2019s legislative plan, from tax reform to infrastructure spending, is effectively on hold until Congress first tackles the Affordable Care Act. White House legislative staffers concluded late last week that the administration was spinning in circles on the health-care plan, amid mounting criticism from conservatives that the administration was fumbling. With Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price on the road with Vice President Pence, a decision was made: Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, would become the point person, though officials insisted Price had not been sidelined. On Friday, Mulvaney convened a meeting at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building with top administration officials and senior staff of House and Senate leaders to hammer out the final details of the proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act...\n\n\"On Capitol Hill, Price is seen by some Republicans as more knowledgeable about health-care policy than Mulvaney, given his experience as a physician and his time as chairman of the House Budget Committee. But Mulvaney benefits from the close relationships he has forged with Trump\u2019s top advisers and with the House\u2019s conservative wing.\"\n\n-- \u201cPatience Gone, Koch-Backed Groups Will Pressure G.O.P. on Health Repeal,\u201d by the New York Times's Jeremy W. Peters: \u201cSaying their patience is at an end, conservative activist groups backed by the billionaire Koch brothers and other powerful interests on the right are mobilizing to pressure Republicans to fulfill their promise to swiftly repeal the Affordable Care Act. Their message is blunt and unforgiving, with the goal of reawakening some of the most extensive conservative grass-roots networks in the country. It is a reminder that even as Republicans control both the White House and Congress for the first time in a decade, the party\u2019s activist wing remains restless and will not go along passively for the sake of party unity. The Koch groups are calling their campaign \u2018You Promised,\u2019 and are prepared to spend heavily, they said. The initial phase, which will cost in the low six figures, will include a nationwide digital advertising campaign featuring testimonials from people who say they were harmed by the Affordable Care Act. On Tuesday, the groups will kick off the effort with a rally near the Capitol \u2026 [and] beyond that, Americans for Prosperity said it was prepared to bring \u2018significant resources\u2019 to bear as needed.\u201d\n\nThe president of the Prince George's County chapter of the National African American Gun Association waits for his turn at the range.

BUT that overall decline has been accompanied by some unusual growth: Gun clubs and shops that cater to black and LGBT clients say there has been an uptick in interest in firearms since November among those who fear that racial and gender-based violence could increase during Trump\u2019s presidency. T. Rees Shapiro and Katie Zezima report: \"Philip Smith, president of the National African American Gun Association, said his group has seen a recent surge that appears to be driven by fear that the nation\u2019s divisive politics could spiral into violence. \u2018Trump is some of that reason, and rhetoric from other groups that have been on the fringe,\u2019 Smith said. \u2018It\u2019s like being racist is cool now.\u2019 Smith said the group has added more than 7,000 members since Election Day and new chapters are popping up all over the country.\"\n\n-- Seattle-area police have been asked to investigate the shooting of a 39-year-old Sikh man as a suspected hate crime, after he was shot in the arm on Friday by a masked man who apparently told him, \u201cGo back to your own country,\u201d before pulling the trigger.

Footage from the event showed police outfitted in riot gear and engaging in shouting matches with several hundred people in the crowd. Many could be seen kicking and hitting one another. Authorities confiscated metal pipes, baseball bats, two-by-four blocks of wood and bricks from the crowd.

(Annie Gowen)\n\n-- A student born and raised in the Washington area has filed a federal lawsuit after she was reportedly denied a tuition assistance grant because of her mother\u2019s immigration status. The suit alleges that the program unfairly discriminates against U.S. citizens with immigrant parents, including those in the U.S. legally \u2013 thus making it harder for them to receive a college degree. (Janell Ross)\n\n-- Tens of thousands of immigrant detainees allege in a lawsuit that they were forced into labor by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- saying they were forced to work for $1 a day, or nothing at all, in violation of anti-slavery laws while held at private prisons. Kristine Phillips reports: \u201cThe lawsuit, filed in 2014 against one of the largest private prison companies in the country, reached class-action status this week after a federal judge\u2019s ruling. That means the case could involve as many as 60,000 immigrants who have been detained. It\u2019s the first time a class-action lawsuit accusing a private U.S. prison company of forced labor has been allowed to move forward...At the heart of the dispute is the Denver Contract Detention Facility, a 1,500-bed center in Aurora, Colo., owned and operated by GEO Group under a contract \u2026 to house immigrants who are awaiting their turn in court. The original nine plaintiffs claim that detainees at the ICE facility are forced to work without pay \u2014 and that those who refuse to do so are threatened with solitary confinement. GEO Group also is accused of violating Colorado\u2019s minimum wage laws by paying detainees $1 day instead of the state\u2019s minimum wage of about $9 an hour \u2026.

The AP reports: \u201cThe executive order calling for a review of a rule protecting small bodies of water from pollution and development is strongly supported by golf course owners who are wary of being forced into expensive cleanups on their fairways. It just so happens that Trump's business holdings include a dozen golf courses in the United States, and critics say his executive order is par for the course: yet another unseemly conflict of interest that would result in a benefit to Trump properties if it goes through. Trump's order targets a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rule \u2014 released under former President Barack Obama in 2015 \u2014 that designates many smaller creeks and wetlands as protected under the Clean Water Act of 1972. \u2018The conflict is disturbing and his failure to completely step away from his business raises questions about his White House actions,\u2019 said Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight.\u201d\n\nGerman infantry fighting vehicles and other military equipment arrives in Lithuania last week.

If it meets the goals Washington is pushing for, Germany \u2014 the region\u2019s economic powerhouse \u2014 would be on the fast track to again become Western Europe\u2019s biggest military power. Since the November election in the United States, the Germans \u2014 caught between Trump\u2019s America and Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia \u2014 are feeling less and less secure. Perhaps nowhere is the prospect of a new future playing out more than here in Lithuania \u2014 where nearly 500 German troops, including a Bavarian combat battalion, arrived in recent weeks for an open-ended deployment near the Russian frontier. The NATO deployment marks what analysts describe as Germany\u2019s most ambitious military operation near the Russian border since the end of the Cold War. Yet \u2026 the deployment is also offering a window into the risks of renewed German strength \u2014 as well as the Russian strategy for repelling it by dwelling on Germany\u2019s dark past.

More than a dozen lawyers with experience in F.C.P.A. prosecution expressed surprise at the Trump Organization\u2019s seemingly lax approach to vetting its foreign partners. But, when I asked a former Trump Organization executive if the Baku deal had seemed unusual, he laughed. \u2018No deal there seems unusual, as long as a check is attached,\u2019 he said.\u201d\n\n-- Mike Pence is quickly becoming a major player in foreign policy. \u201cThe role and influence of the vice president, not enshrined in any law, is determined in any administration by three things: his direct relationship with the president, his building of a personal portfolio of issues, and the effectiveness of his team. When it comes to foreign policy, Vice President Pence is quietly succeeding on all three fronts,\u201d Josh Rogin writes. \u201cPence, a traditional hawk influenced heavily by his Christian faith, is carefully and deliberately assuming a stance that fits within the president\u2019s agenda while respecting the prerogatives of other senior White House aides who also want to play large foreign policy roles \u2026 [and] is seen by many in Washington as a figure who might stand up for the traditionally hawkish views he espoused while in Congress \u2026 It\u2019s a tricky balancing act, but if Pence can keep the president\u2019s trust, stay above the internal politics and build out his portfolio, he will be able to continue to increase his influence on foreign policy inside the White House and on the world stage.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cLittle-known governor runs as the hope and change candidate in South Korea,\u201d by Anna Fifield: \u201cHe\u2019s styling himself as the 'hope and change' candidate competing against an establishment figure in South Korea\u2019s Democratic Party primary contest.
