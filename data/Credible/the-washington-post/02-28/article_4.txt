Republican chief executives struggled for years with the politically-thorny question of whether to take federal money to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2017/live-updates/health-care/obamacare-affordable-care-act-definitions/what-is-the-aca-medicaid-expansion/?tid=a_inl&amp;utm_term=.7da18b1e2061\">expand Medicaid</a> under the Affordable Care Act.</p> <p>Regardless of which choice they made, and no matter how much they oppose the underlying law, <strong>every governor is now nervous about what exactly Congress might do. </strong>Those who didn\u2019t take the money are worried their states will now get short shrift in a replacement plan, and those who have expanded the rolls fear that the federal government is about to leave them in a lurch by not providing enough money to pay for the entitlement they expanded. States that have expanded Medicaid are also concerned about per-capita caps and cutting eligibility levels, among other things.</p> <p><strong>The differing priorities of the expansion states and the non-expansion states make it very difficult for the GOP\u2019s gubernatorial wing to present a unified front. </strong>This divide carries over to Congress, as well: About half of the Republicans in the House hail from states that expanded Medicaid.</p> <p><strong>As Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a former hospital executive who didn\u2019t take the money, puts it: \u201cYou can\u2019t treat my state worse than an expansion state.\u201d </strong>He conveyed to the president during multiple meetings this weekend that states which did not expand Medicaid should receive financial compensation and additional flexibility.</p> <div class=\"inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-center horizontal-photo\"> <img class=\"zoom-in\" src=\"https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/1a7eed01a41eb3c916fa1a09dd1a62d7-908-624-Pence_Governors_Meeting_618129f19f.jpg\"> <div class=\"pb-caption\"> Mike Pence welcomes governors to the Naval Observatory on Friday, as Michigan Gov.

Rick Snyder, on the other side of the debate, carries around a stack of fact sheets that list how his decision to expand Medicaid has directly benefited Michiganders.</strong> \u201cLiterally we\u2019ve saved lives,\u201d he said.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The former head of Gateway Computers is an earnest technocrat who has often bristled at the ideologues in his party since he took office seven years ago. </strong>A certified public accountant by training, he remains more of a numbers guy than a politician. Since the inauguration last month, he has been in close touch with fellow expansion-state governors.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>\u201cI have no interest of being left with the bag on something that just isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d Snyder explained during an extended interview. </strong>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t give myself a block grant. We need to be held accountable. \u2026 Many are looking at this as a static question: How much money are we going to get? Is it a block grant or per capita? The real question is: What escalator would you use for future years to address the fact that you have this huge inflationary cost cycle? Fundamentally, a lot of people are skipping over that. I\u2019m worried to death about that. \u2026 You could reach collapse fairly quickly if you don\u2019t fundamentally move the (cost) curve. We need to have a very thoughtful discussion about what that means. \u2026 I am willing to live with something less than medical inflation \u2026 but you\u2019ve got to give me some fair metrics and flexibility to do that.\u201d</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>An independent analysis prepared for the nonpartisan National Governors Association has further elevated concerns among this crowd.</strong>&nbsp;The 36-page document, a copy of which was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gop-changes-to-obamacare-could-cost-states-reduce-coverage-governors-told/2017/02/25/074ae840-fbba-11e6-9845-576c69081518_story.html\">obtained by Dan Balz</a>, concluded that changes being floated by House Republican leadership could significantly reduce the number of Americans with health insurance and potentially cost states billions of dollars over five years. The report from the consulting firm Avalere Health, presented during a closed-door meeting at the J.W. Marriott on Saturday, said that caps on Medicaid spending would probably result in state funding gaps and that future reductions in federal funding \u201cmay lead to cuts in eligibility, benefits or payment rates.\u201d The report\u2019s analysis of the individual marketplace examined the effect of shifting from the current system of income-based tax credits to age-based credits. \u201cA hypothetical expansion state with 300,000 people using the individual markets could see a 30-percent decline in the number of people insured and 90,000 more people without insurance,\u201d Balz explains. \u201cStates that did not expand Medicaid could see a 50 percent decline in coverage.\"</p> </div> <div class=\"inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-center horizontal-photo\"> <img class=\"zoom-in\" src=\"https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/600afb58a4d3566982a1af675cfac3a5-908-698-Pence_Governors_Meeting_38630a124c.jpg\"> <div class=\"pb-caption\"> Nevada Gov.

Nevada is one of the fastest-growing states in the country, so if you\u2019re going to benchmark me three years ago, that\u2019s going to punish Nevada,\u201d he explained.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Without giving specifics, Sandoval said he received certain assurances from senior administration officials. But, he added, \u201cOf course I\u2019m concerned. \u2026 It works both ways. \u2026 Depending on the formula, you don\u2019t want to penalize those that chose not to expand but at the same time you don\u2019t want to penalize states like mine.\u201d</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, who did not expand Medicaid, is much more supportive of per-capita caps and block grants than someone like Sandoval. </strong>He notes that he has the youngest population on average of any state, so his health care costs are much lower than next-door Arizona, which is home to many retirees. \u201cWe have a different need for health care than if you\u2019re in Arizona,\u201d said Herbet. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s going to be an impossibility, but at least let\u2019s get as close to fairness as we can.\u201d</p> </div> <div class=\"inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-center horizontal-photo\"> <img class=\"zoom-in\" src=\"https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/abb00f462a1bbfe90255698b8af13631-908-605-646034828.jpg\"> <div class=\"pb-caption\"> Ted Cruz arrives for a vote on the Senate floor last night.

Kasich, who represents an expansion state, spent 45 minutes pitching Trump on not making the kind of drastic changes that some on his staff want to pursue.

At one point, Kushner reminded his father-in-law that House Republicans are sketching out a different approach to providing access to coverage. \u201cWell, I like this better,\u201d Trump replied, according to a Kasich adviser.

Republican chief executives struggled for years with the politically-thorny question of whether to take federal money to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRegardless of which choice they made, and no matter how much they oppose the underlying law, every governor is now nervous about what exactly Congress might do. Those who didn\u2019t take the money are worried their states will now get short shrift in a replacement plan, and those who have expanded the rolls fear that the federal government is about to leave them in a lurch by not providing enough money to pay for the entitlement they expanded. States that have expanded Medicaid are also concerned about per-capita caps and cutting eligibility levels, among other things.\n\nThe differing priorities of the expansion states and the non-expansion states make it very difficult for the GOP\u2019s gubernatorial wing to present a unified front. This divide carries over to Congress, as well: About half of the Republicans in the House hail from states that expanded Medicaid.\n\nAs Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a former hospital executive who didn\u2019t take the money, puts it: \u201cYou can\u2019t treat my state worse than an expansion state.\u201d He conveyed to the president during multiple meetings this weekend that states which did not expand Medicaid should receive financial compensation and additional flexibility.\n\nMike Pence welcomes governors to the Naval Observatory on Friday, as Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder looks on from the left and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe looks on from the right. (Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nGov. Rick Snyder, on the other side of the debate, carries around a stack of fact sheets that list how his decision to expand Medicaid has directly benefited Michiganders. \u201cLiterally we\u2019ve saved lives,\u201d he said. The former head of Gateway Computers is an earnest technocrat who has often bristled at the ideologues in his party since he took office seven years ago. A certified public accountant by training, he remains more of a numbers guy than a politician. Since the inauguration last month, he has been in close touch with fellow expansion-state governors. \u201cI have no interest of being left with the bag on something that just isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d Snyder explained during an extended interview. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give myself a block grant. We need to be held accountable. \u2026 Many are looking at this as a static question: How much money are we going to get? Is it a block grant or per capita? The real question is: What escalator would you use for future years to address the fact that you have this huge inflationary cost cycle? Fundamentally, a lot of people are skipping over that. I\u2019m worried to death about that. \u2026 You could reach collapse fairly quickly if you don\u2019t fundamentally move the (cost) curve. We need to have a very thoughtful discussion about what that means. \u2026 I am willing to live with something less than medical inflation \u2026 but you\u2019ve got to give me some fair metrics and flexibility to do that.\u201d An independent analysis prepared for the nonpartisan National Governors Association has further elevated concerns among this crowd. The 36-page document, a copy of which was obtained by Dan Balz, concluded that changes being floated by House Republican leadership could significantly reduce the number of Americans with health insurance and potentially cost states billions of dollars over five years. The report from the consulting firm Avalere Health, presented during a closed-door meeting at the J.W. Marriott on Saturday, said that caps on Medicaid spending would probably result in state funding gaps and that future reductions in federal funding \u201cmay lead to cuts in eligibility, benefits or payment rates.\u201d The report\u2019s analysis of the individual marketplace examined the effect of shifting from the current system of income-based tax credits to age-based credits. \u201cA hypothetical expansion state with 300,000 people using the individual markets could see a 30-percent decline in the number of people insured and 90,000 more people without insurance,\u201d Balz explains. \u201cStates that did not expand Medicaid could see a 50 percent decline in coverage.\"\n\nNevada Gov. Brian Sandoval poses for a photo with Mike and Karen Pence during a luncheon with other governors at the Naval Observatory. (Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nNevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, meanwhile, says expanding Medicaid \u201chas been very beneficial to my state.\u201d He is apprehensive about per-capita caps being discussed by key Republicans in Congress, which have support from other governors. \u201cHow do you benchmark that? Nevada is one of the fastest-growing states in the country, so if you\u2019re going to benchmark me three years ago, that\u2019s going to punish Nevada,\u201d he explained. Without giving specifics, Sandoval said he received certain assurances from senior administration officials. But, he added, \u201cOf course I\u2019m concerned. \u2026 It works both ways. \u2026 Depending on the formula, you don\u2019t want to penalize those that chose not to expand but at the same time you don\u2019t want to penalize states like mine.\u201d Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, who did not expand Medicaid, is much more supportive of per-capita caps and block grants than someone like Sandoval. He notes that he has the youngest population on average of any state, so his health care costs are much lower than next-door Arizona, which is home to many retirees. \u201cWe have a different need for health care than if you\u2019re in Arizona,\u201d said Herbet. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s going to be an impossibility, but at least let\u2019s get as close to fairness as we can.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz arrives for a vote on the Senate floor last night. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nThe conversation among the governors comes as conservatives in both chambers of Congress rebel against a draft replacement plan being considered by House leaders that leaked out last week. Because Republicans only have 52 seats in the Senate, three defections can kill anything. So it was meaningful last night when Rand Paul, Mike Lee and Ted Cruz said they would not support the current House plan because it preserves too much of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n2 yrs ago, the GOP Congress voted to repeal Obamacare. That 2015 repeal language should be the floor, the bare minimum. #FullRepeal \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) February 28, 2017\n\nThe leaders of the very conservative House Freedom Caucus, Mark Meadows, and the Republican Study Committee, Mark Walker, also both came out against that plan yesterday. They don\u2019t like refundable tax credits included in the draft, which they see as a new entitlement program and Obamacare Lite.\n\nModerates, though, have made clear that they cannot get on board with only a straight repeal of Obamacare. A critical mass of lawmakers says a replacement needs to be in place first.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, top White House aides are increasingly divided over how much political capital to spend on health care. Juliet Eilperin and Amy Goldstein have an inside look at the two camps:\n\n\u201cSeveral people in Trump\u2019s orbit are eager to make bold changes to reduce the government\u2019s role in the health-care system. That camp includes Vice President Pence \u2026 as well as Domestic Policy Council aides Andrew Bremberg and Katy Talento and National Economic Council aide Brian \u00adBlase. Blase \u2026 published a paper in December (that) emphasized the \u2018need to reduce government bias towards comprehensive coverage\u2019 for all Americans and a revamping of Medicaid. \u2026 \u2018Medicaid needs fundamental reform with the goals of dramatically reducing the number of people enrolled in the program and providing a higher-quality program for remaining enrollees,\u2019 Blase wrote.\n\nThat camp includes Vice President Pence \u2026 as well as Domestic Policy Council aides Andrew Bremberg and Katy Talento and National Economic Council aide Brian \u00adBlase.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 27, 2017\n\nThe president himself remains the biggest wildcard in this whole process. In public and private, he has said he wants to provide health coverage \u201cfor everybody\u201d while lowering its cost. But Tom Price testified during his confirmation hearings that the administration would seek to give Americans access to, not guaranteed, coverage.\n\nA Friday afternoon meeting with John Kasich underscored how the president really could go any number of ways still. Juliet and Amy report that the Ohio governor and his ex-rival for the nomination had no set agenda. Kasich, who represents an expansion state, spent 45 minutes pitching Trump on not making the kind of drastic changes that some on his staff want to pursue. As the governor spoke, Trump called in several top aides and got Price on the phone. At one point, Kushner reminded his father-in-law that House Republicans are sketching out a different approach to providing access to coverage. \u201cWell, I like this better,\u201d Trump replied, according to a Kasich adviser. Trump ended the meeting by telling Price and Reince Priebus to meet with Kasich the following day.\n\nThen, on Saturday, Trump had lunch with Florida\u2019s Rick Scott and Wisconsin\u2019s Scott Walker, who both opted not to expand Medicaid. Both Republicans, who unlike Kasich supported the president during the fall campaign, came away with the impression that Trump is on their side in this policy debate.\n\nWalker explained that, without taking the expansion, his state still got Medicaid coverage for everyone living below the poverty line. Those above the line, who would have qualified to join Medicaid if he\u2019d taken the money, were pushed toward the marketplace. \u201cYou can\u2019t cut Medicaid,\u201d the chairman of the Republican Governors Association said. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s just no way about it. There\u2019s a base population in our state. \u2026 We want to make sure we help other states get to a position where they could do something similar to that going forward.\u201d\n\nWatching the Republicans squabble, Chuck Schumer said yesterday that Republicans may fail to muster 50 votes in the Senate to repeal the law. \u201cI predict the discord in their party will grow as Republicans return to Washington after this last week of angry town halls,\u201d the minority leader said at the National Press Club. \u201cI believe the odds are very high we will keep the ACA.\u201d Democratic governors are united, meanwhile, in opposing the approaches being discussed by Hill Republicans. \u201cWhenever the federal government mentions the word block grants, let us be crystal clear, they are saving money and it's going to cost the states,\u201d said Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), who could not persuade a GOP legislature to expand Medicaid.\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning newsletter.

(Tony Gutierrez/AP)\n\n43 SPEAKS OUT:\n\n-- For eight years, George W. Bush carefully avoided criticizing Barack Obama. But he cannot bite his tongue about Trump. The former president is willing to express disagreement with the sitting president of his own party because he is so concerned about what's happening to the country he loves so much: \u201cI don\u2019t like the racism and I don\u2019t like the name-calling and I don\u2019t like the people feeling alienated,\u201d the 70-year-old told People Magazine in an interview that posted overnight. \u201cNobody likes that.\u201d Bush, who did not vote for Trump or Hillary Clinton, called the political climate in Trump\u2019s Washington \u201cpretty ugly,\u201d even as he expressed optimism about America\u2019s future.\n\nOn the \u201cToday\u201d show to promote his new book of oil paintings, Bush refused to endorse Trump\u2019s travel ban, defending religious freedom as he warned that the terror threat is not a religious one, but an ideological one: \u201cI think it's very important for all of us to recognize one of our great strengths is for people to be able to worship the way they want to or to not worship at all. A bedrock of our freedom is the right to worship freely.\u201d\n\nHe also spoke out about Trump\u2019s claim that the media is the \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d warning that an independent press is \u201cessential\u201d to democracy. \u201cIt's kind of hard to tell others to have an independent free press when we're not willing to have one ourselves,\u201d Bush said on \"Today,\" citing Russia as an example.\n\nAsked by People if he felt compelled to play a leadership role in these divisive times, Bush said no: \u201cWhen President Obama got elected, friends would call: \u2018You must speak out! You must do this, you must do that.\u2019 Turns out, other people are doing the same thing this time. I didn\u2019t feel like speaking out before because I didn\u2019t want to complicate the job and I\u2019m not going to this time. However, at the Bush Center we are speaking up.\u201d George and Laura, sitting together, then listed some of the center\u2019s work that stands in contrast to Trump\u2019s isolationism: immigration ceremonies, women\u2019s reproductive-health programs in Africa, and leadership training for Muslim women that the Bush Center brings to Texas from the Middle East. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of ways to speak out,\u201d the former president says, \u201cbut it\u2019s really through actions defending the values important to Laura and me. \u2026 We\u2019re a blessed nation, and we ought to help others.\u201d\n\n-- Quite a contrast: Trump has long dismissed protests against his presidency as ruses planned by his political enemies. But in an interview for \"Fox and Friends\" this morning, he alleged a new culprit: Barack Obama. \"I think that President Obama is behind it because his people certainly are behind it,\" the president said of his predecessor. \"In terms of him being behind things, that's politics. It will probably continue.\" (Philip Rucker)\n\nWilbur Ross speaks during a Senate confirmation hearing. (T.J.

That move, the sources said, could come as early as Wednesday. ... The problem Ricketts has encountered is that family business holdings he is linked to are so numerous and widespread that many of the duties of deputy commerce secretary could intersect with them.\"\n\nGET SMART FAST:\n\nSpaceX announced plans to fly two private citizens around the moon in a spaceship in 2018, as part of a week-long lunar journey that would travel deeper into space than any human has ventured before.

Sari Horwitz reports: \u201cIn its motion filed Monday, the department sought to 'dismiss the discriminatory purpose claim,' or, in other words, abandon its argument that the Texas law is intentionally racially discriminatory. Justice Department lawyers said in their filing Monday that rather than continuing to litigate the question of the Texas legislature\u2019s intention in passing the law, the federal government wants to give state lawmakers an opportunity to adjust the rule. The Texas case is the first window into how the Trump administration and [Jeff Sessions] will approach the highly charged issue of voting rights.\"\n\n-- Trump will today direct the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to roll back the Obama-era \u201cWaters of the United States\u201d rule, which could ultimately make it easier for agricultural interests and developers to drain wetlands and small streams. Juliet Eilperin and Abby Phillip report: \u201cThe directive is aimed to address the concerns of about 30 states and an array of business interests that have criticized the previous administration for overreaching. It will likely trigger a fresh round of rulemaking, but could also lead to extensive litigation as the agencies seek to redefine federal restrictions on what accounts for 60 percent of the nation\u2019s water bodies. The push to unravel the rule marks yet another shift in a decades-long debate over to what extent the federal government can dictate activities affecting the wetlands, rivers and streams that feed into major water bodies. The controversy has spurred two separate Supreme Court decisions, as well as a more recent federal appellate court ruling, as the two previous administrations sought to resolve the matter through executive actions.\"\n\n-- The president personally signed off on Sean Spicer's decision to go through aides' cell phones in a hunt for leaks, multiple sources told CNN. \u201cThe decision sent a signal across the administration that Trump is furious at leaks from inside the White House,\u201d Jeff Zeleny and Daniella Diaz report. \u201cThe sources also said the President gave his blessing before Spicer blocked reporters from the briefing last Friday.\u201d Spicer, naturally, denied that Trump had been involved in either decision.\n\nA PREVIEW OF TRUMP'S BUDGET:\n\n-- The White House announced the first details of Trump\u2019s spending plan yesterday, outlining plans to boost defense spending by $54 billion while delivering equal cuts to spending at the EPA and State Department, particularly foreign aid. It was the first indication of spending priorities from the new administration, Kelsey Snell and Abby Phillip report. \"Officials skirted questions about whether the budget would include proposals to slow the growth of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid \u2026 Spicer insisted Monday that the president intends to keep his campaign promise to preserve the programs, but avoided commenting on whether there is any wiggle room, such as protecting current beneficiaries while implementing future changes.\" Trump also said Monday that the government is \u201cgoing to start spending on infrastructure \u2014 big\u201d and that law enforcement programs will see higher budgets.\n\n-- Veterans of past budget battles questioned whether the proposed cuts are realistic. From Elise Viebeck: \u201cRep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), who chairs a House Appropriations subcommittee, said flatly that spending bills cutting upward of $50 billion in nondefense spending could not pass the Republican House. \u2018You can\u2019t get there from here,\u2019 he said, noting that increases are needed to implement GOP priorities in the departments of Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security. \u2018There\u2019s more to the government than defense.\u2019\u201d\n\nSome Republican defense hawks, on the other side, called Trump\u2019s defense request inadequate: \u201cWith a world on fire, America cannot secure peace through strength with just 3 percent more than President Obama\u2019s budget,\u201d John McCain said in a statement. \u201cWe can and must do better.\u201d\n\nPaul Ryan tried to avoid weighing in on any the specifics, saying he wants to see all the details that will be released next month before commenting.\n\n-- More than 120 retired generals and admirals signed a letter to lawmakers pushing back against the administration\u2019s proposed cut to foreign aid.

The AP: \u201cEmails released under court order last week in response to a different public records request yielded additional examples where emails were addressed to Pruitt's private account, including a 2013 exchange with a petroleum industry lobbyist who emailed Pruitt and a lawyer on the attorney general's staff. That suggests Pruitt made his private email address available to professional contacts outside his office. It is not illegal in Oklahoma for public officials to use private email as long as they are retained and made available as public records. [Still], Pruitt\u2019s use of the private account appears to directly contradict statements he made last month as part of his Senate confirmation.\u201d\n\n-- Outgoing U.S. diplomat Dan Fried used his retirement party at the State Department to describe a \u201cGrand Strategy\" for America that is at odds with Trump's. For decades, the U.S. has stood for \u201can open, rules-based world, with a united West at its core,\u201d Michael Gerson relays in his column. \"But what, Fried asked, would happen if the U.S. left the global order to pursue its own 'ethno-national greatness,' in a way proposed by populists such as Steve Bannon? 'By abandoning our American Grand Strategy,' he argued, 'we would diminish to being just another zero-sum great power.' This would result in a system entirely based on 'spheres of influence,' which \u2026 would \u2018mean our acquiescence when great powers, starting with China and Russia, dominated their neighbors through force and fear. \u2018Some so-called realists,' said Fried, 'might accept such a world as making the best of a harsh world, but it is not realistic to expect that it would be peaceful or stable. Rather the reverse: A sphere of influence system would lead to cycles of rebellion and repression, and, if the past 1,000 years is any guide, lead to war between the great powers, because no power would be satisfied with its sphere. They never are.\u2019\"\n\n-- Jon Huntsman, the former U.S. ambassador to China and failed presidential candidate, is under consideration to be Rex Tillerson\u2019s No. 2. at the State Department, per the Wall Street Journal: \u201cMr. Huntsman, who had previously been considered for secretary of state, is also under consideration for an ambassadorship. The search for a deputy secretary of state has continued after Trump rejected Elliott Abrams, who had the backing of Tillerson, for the position. No final decision has been taken, and other candidates may be under discussion.\"\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT TONIGHT:\n\n-- Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at 9 p.m. Eastern. Billed as a \u201cState of the Union\u201d-style address, the remarks will ostensibly give the president a chance to defend his agenda and governing style, Elise Viebeck previews. \u201cChaos around the travel ban, Michael Flynn\u2019s resignation as national security adviser and the withdrawal of federal nominees have raised concerns with some GOP lawmakers about Trump\u2019s leadership, and they\u2019ll be looking to his speech for reasons to feel more confident. There\u2019s a lot to watch for in the speech, but the tone Trump will take toward America\u2019s problems is already a big topic of speculation. Will the president paint a picture of a dark and frightening America he\u2019s working to rescue, as he did during his inauguration speech? Or will Trump aim for a brighter, more inspiring image of the challenges we face?\u201d\n\n-- The White House announced the seven guests who will sit with the first lady during tonight\u2019s speech.

The statements allege that top male managers \u2026 dispatched scouting parties to stores to find female employees they wanted to sleep with, laughed about women\u2019s bodies in the workplace, and pushed female subordinates into sex by pledging better jobs, higher pay or protection from punishment.\u201d The class-action case was first filed in 2008 and remains unresolved. It now includes 69,000 women. \u201cMany of the most striking allegations stem from the company\u2019s annual managers meetings, which former employees described as a boozy, no-spouses-allowed \u2018sex-fest\u2019 where attendance was mandatory and women were aggressively pursued, grabbed and harassed.\u201d Sterling disputes the allegations.\n\nAngel and Jacqueline Rayos-Garcia stand with their father in the back yard of their home.

It was hard enough mustering the energy to get through the meetings with activists, the phone calls with lawyers, the restless nights. For his first time making dinner for his kids since his wife, Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, was deported, this would have to do. On Feb. 8, their mother checked in for a routine appointment with immigration officials in the Phoenix area. The following day, the 35-year-old mother was deported to Mexico, a country she hadn\u2019t known in the two decades since she left at age 14 \u2026 As a country [reevaluates] its position on undocumented immigrants, they would have to reevaluate a life without the one who mattered most to them.\"\n\n-- \u201cIn Japan, a scandal over a school threatens to entangle Abe,\u201d by Anna Fifield: \u201cJapan\u2019s prime minister is facing the biggest crisis of his tenure, caught up in a burgeoning scandal that involves a shady land deal, allegations of a coverup and a kindergarten sending out notes about \u2018wicked\u2019 Koreans and Chinese. Shinzo Abe strongly denies any wrongdoing, and his wife, Akie Abe, has resigned as \u2018honorary principal\u2019 \u2026 But the scandal shows no sign of going away anytime soon. Children aged 3 to 5 who attend the private kindergarten sing the national anthem in front of the Japanese flag and recite the Imperial Rescript on Education, an 1890 tract that calls on Japanese to \u2018offer yourselves courageously to the state\u2019 to \u2018guard and maintain the prosperity of our Imperial throne.\u2019 The rescript was abolished after Japan\u2019s defeat in World War II \u2026 [Now], the case \u2026 but it also could cause a diplomatic storm with Japan\u2019s closest neighbors. \u2018Prime Minister Abe might think this story is a minor issue, but it has the potential to become very damaging,\u2019 Itagaki said.\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nThis photo of Kellyanne Conway sitting on the Oval Office couch as Trump met with leaders of Historically Black Colleges and Universities has gone viral on social media:\n\n(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nSome expressed disgust, including the deputy editorial page editor of The Wall Street Journal:\n\nIf Rice or Jarrett had sat like this in Oval Office conservatives would have screamed themselves hoarse for weeks.

That\u2019s because populism is a \u2018thin ideology \u2026\u2019 according to Cas Mudde, a [University of Georgia [professor] \u2026 An ideology like fascism involves a holistic view of how politics, the economy, and society as a whole should be ordered . Populism doesn\u2019t; it calls for kicking out the political establishment, but it doesn\u2019t specify what should replace it. So it\u2019s usually paired with \u2018thicker\u2019 left- or right-wing ideologies like socialism or nationalism.\u201d\n\nNo definition of populism will fully describe all populists.
