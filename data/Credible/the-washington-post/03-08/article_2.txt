He said he plans to become personally involved in persuading wavering lawmakers. And he warned that Republicans will suffer badly in the midterms if they fail to deliver on their campaign promises to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. One member who was in the private meeting told <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/07/politics/donald-trump-health-care/\">CNN</a> that he even spoke of an electoral \u201cbloodbath.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Offering a taste of what\u2019s to come, POTUS took to Twitter a few hours later to nudge Rand Paul</strong>, a 2016 rival for the GOP nomination who is now a potentially pivotal vote in the Senate:</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I feel sure that my friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RandPaul\">@RandPaul</a> will come along with the new and great health care program because he knows Obamacare is a disaster!</p>\u2014 Donald J.

Yesterday he lunched with Lindsey Graham. The South Carolina senator, as a gesture of goodwill, gave the president his new cell phone number. This is notable because, during a 2015 rally, Trump read Graham\u2019s old number aloud to a crowd and asked people to call him.</p> <p><strong>Trump has negotiated big deals, but he\u2019s never done anything quite like this. There will be a steep learning curve. </strong>\u201cFollowing late-afternoon votes Tuesday, several Republican senators privately groused that they felt rushed by their GOP colleagues in the House and by Trump, who they said does not fully grasp the Senate\u2019s slower pace or its concerns,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-leaders-brace-for-the-task-ahead-selling-obamacare-lite/2017/03/07/ab2f721e-02e5-11e7-ad5b-d22680e18d10_story.html\">Mike DeBonis, Robert Costa and David Weigel report</a>. \u201cThe senators also expressed skepticism that key White House officials with deep ties to Congress\u2019s conservative wing would eventually be able to lock up the votes for the current plan. Instead, they said there is confusion over who is managing the process and which administration figures, if any, have power to sway Trump on the issue.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Just how much political capital Trump is willing to spend is an open question that could determine the fate of the 2010 law. </strong>Will he keep his tweets gentle like the one aimed at Paul last night or will they take on a harder, more personal edge? You could imagine him lashing out at leaders of Freedom Caucus on a Saturday morning, for instance, blaming them for the failure of his agenda. Perhaps the fear of drawing his ire \u2013 a credible threat based on his track record \u2013 will get some members off of the fence. There are other ways he could use his power: Would he have rallies in the states or districts of wavering lawmakers? Will his new outside group run ads promoting the bill or criticizing those who oppose him?</p> <p><strong>There\u2019s an emerging sense among some in Trump World that repeal and replace will not happen without muscular leadership from the president, but there\u2019s also a growing recognition of the political risks that come with wading in deeply. </strong>Four are top of mind:</p> <div class=\"inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-center horizontal-photo\"> <img class=\"zoom-in\" src=\"https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/e0dbd81470426ee5894cf9407dee7578-908-605-Botsford170307Trump12459.jpg\"> <div class=\"pb-caption\"> Donald Trump enters a meeting with the House Deputy Whip team in the East Room at the White House yesterday. (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) </div> </div> <p><strong>1. RUNNING AFOUL OF CONSERVATIVES IN THE GOP CIVIL WAR:</strong></p> <p>The battle lines are drawn. <strong>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-historic-health-care-moment-1488931460\">Wall Street Journal editorial board</a> support the Ryan plan. The Koch network (led by Americans for Prosperity), the Club for Growth, FreedomWorks, Heritage Action and Breitbart vocally opposed it.</strong> People on the right have dubbed the plan <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/03/07/obamacare-lite-rinocare-conservatives-rebel-against-gops-aca-bill/\">\u201cObamacare Lite\u201d or \u201cRyanCare.\u201d</a></p> <p><strong>Many of these groups opposing the draft bill have never viewed Trump as an authentic movement conservative.</strong> If they see him as joining forces with the establishment to ram through something that is tantamount to a new government entitlement, it will only bolster their skepticism. It\u2019s not out of the question that Trump will have a primary challenger from his right to contend with in three years, and this could be a data point.</p> <p><strong>2. BACKLASH FROM SENIORS:</strong></p> <p>Seniors constitute Trump\u2019s core base of support. Exit polls showed that <strong>the septuagenarian really ran up the score with older people</strong> vis-\u00e0-vis Mitt Romney, and this might have made the difference in several states.</p> <p><strong>The draft legislation Trump embraces would undo a rule from the ACA that allows insurers to charge their oldest customers no more than three times what they charge their youngest and healthiest ones. Insurers could now charge five times as much. </strong></p> <p><strong>AARP has already begun mobilizing its members on this point.</strong> David Certner, the senior lobby\u2019s legislative counsel, said the group is particularly concerned about the effect on Americans ages 50 to 64 if that age-charge differential is to increase. Low-income Americans in that older group would \u201cget hammered,\u201d he said, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/income-separates-the-winners-and-losers-in-republicans-health-care-plans/2017/03/07/8bbc1a94-0345-11e7-ad5b-d22680e18d10_story.html\">per Amy Goldstein and Juliet Eilperin</a>.</p> <p><strong>Expect to see hundreds of anecdotes like this one over the coming months: </strong>\u201cMartha Brawley of Monroe, N.C., said she voted for President Trump in the hope he could make insurance more affordable. But on Tuesday, Ms. Brawley, 55, was feeling increasingly nervous based on what she had heard about the new plan from television news reports,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/health/risk-of-losing-health-insurance-in-republican-plan.html?_r=0\">the New York Times </a>reports. \u201cShe pays about $260 per month for a Blue Cross plan and receives a subsidy of $724 per month to cover the rest of her premium. Under the House plan, she would receive $3,500 a year in tax credits \u2014 $5,188 less than she gets under the Affordable Care Act. \u2018I\u2019m scared, I\u2019ll tell you that right now, to think about not having insurance at my age,\u2019 said Ms. Brawley, who underwent a liver biopsy on Monday after her doctor found that she has an autoimmune liver disease. \u2018If I didn\u2019t have insurance, these doctors wouldn\u2019t see me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p><strong>3. THE 2020 FACTOR: </strong></p> <p>Timing is everything in politics. <strong>If the disastrous rollout of healthcare.gov happened in Oct. 2012, instead of Oct. 2013, Obama very well might have lost reelection.</strong> Recognizing the risks of implementation, they postponed a lot of deadlines until after elections.</p> <p><strong>The most striking thing about studying the draft House bills is how much stuff comes due in 2020, when Trump has already announced he will be running for reelection and Republicans will be fighting to preserve their narrow majority in the Senate.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u201cThe changes to the Medicaid expansion and the subsidy system would take hold at the beginning of 2020,\u201d</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2017/03/07/the-gops-new-repeal-plan-could-blow-up-in-republicans-faces-heres-how/?utm_term=.fca9ce9d0044\">Greg Sargent observes</a>. \u201cDemocratic candidates will be able to blast Republicans who voted for the GOP replacement, on the grounds that it is resulting in their states\u2019 residents getting tossed off of coverage, while vowing to replace the spending. <strong>Some GOP senators up for reelection in 2020 in swing states also happen to represent states that already opted into the Medicaid expansion. That includes Joni Ernst in Iowa and Cory Gardner in Colorado.</strong> There\u2019s also Thom Tillis in North Carolina (which didn\u2019t expand Medicaid but could lose a lot in subsidies). <strong>\u2018The Republican health-care plan as it stands today would certainly endanger some Republican incumbents up in 2020,\u2019 said Jennifer Duffy, who tracks Senate races at the Cook Political Report. </strong>Some of these senators got elected by campaigning against the ACA\u2019s rollout problems amid the shriveled midterm electorate of 2014 and will now face reelection in a presidential year, as repeal\u2019s impact takes hold.\u201d</p> <p><strong>4. HE FULLY OWNS FAILURE:</strong></p> <p><strong>The more aggressively he sells the bill, the more he will be identified with its collapse if things don\u2019t work out.</strong></p> <p><strong>The margin for error is small:</strong> They can afford to lose 21 Republicans in the House and just two in the Senate. &nbsp;The House Freedom Caucus has about 30 members. Several of them held a press conference outside the Capitol to say they\u2019d never vote for the measure as it stands now. They ideally want straight repeal with nothing else, which is just never going to happen. In addition to Paul and Cruz, Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) opposed the House draft yesterday. If the three of them voted no, the measure would fail.</p> <p><strong>But, but, but: Every concession that\u2019s made to win over the Freedom Caucus and that trio in the Senate <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/03/07/the-three-gop-factions-that-could-sink-republicans-obamacare-replacement-bill/?utm_term=.273bfdfd3a5c\">makes it harder</a> to lock down the votes of someone like Susan Collins or Rob Portman.</strong> The Ohio senator who was one of four Republicans to declare this week that he\u2019ll oppose any plan that hurts lower-income folks who benefited from expanding Medicaid under the law. The others are Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), Cory Gardner (Colo.) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska).</p> <p><strong>Mitch McConnell said yesterday that the Senate will pass a repeal bill before Easter recess: </strong>\u201cSenior GOP sources said <strong>the leadership team will employ an \u2018arm-breaking\u2019 whip strategy to get the required 50 votes</strong>,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/aca-senate-politics-235796\">Politico\u2019s Burgess Everett </a>reports.</p> <p><strong>This \u201carm-breaking\u201d approach could backfire, however. </strong>One Republican senator said on background last night that <strong>several senators are asking their leadership to \u201ctake it easy\u201d in terms of the timeline</strong>, allowing space to debate and analyze the proposal with a \u201cclear understanding of the costs involved,\u201d per <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-leaders-brace-for-the-task-ahead-selling-obamacare-lite/2017/03/07/ab2f721e-02e5-11e7-ad5b-d22680e18d10_story.html\">DeBonis, Costa and Weigel\u2019s story</a> on the state of play. \u201cIf that takes months or a year, so be it,\u201d the senator said. <strong>A second GOP senator said the party was making a \u201cmistake\u201d in its rollout by taking \u201ctoo much ownership\u201d of health care after years in which Democrats were identified with Obamacare. </strong></p> <div class=\"inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-center horizontal-photo\"> <img class=\"zoom-in\" src=\"https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/edead40d763f783105dc34bcdca3ce5a-908-648-649316214.jpg\"> <div class=\"pb-caption\"> Mike Pence speaks to reporters after joining Senate Republicans for their weekly policy lunch yesterday.

Sun:</strong> \u201cThe Republican health-care bill would eliminate funds for fundamental public health programs, including for the prevention of bioterrorism and disease outbreaks, as well as money to provide immunizations and heart-disease screenings. As part of the ACA, the Prevention and Public Health Fund provides almost $1 billion annually to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 2010, the fund has been an increasingly important source of money for core CDC programs, today accounting for about 12 percent of the CDC\u2019s total budget. The GOP bill would eliminate the Prevention and Public Health Fund starting in October of next year. No clear replacement has been proposed. Cuts in those funds, combined with potential federal budget cuts at the CDC and other health agencies, \u2018could amount to a catastrophic year for public health funding,\u2019 according to a statement from the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.\u201d</p> <p><strong>-- \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/03/08/what-the-gop-health-plan-really-means-for-taxes/?utm_term=.55a007f26ecf\">Here are five ways the GOP proposal would change the tax system</a>,\u201d via WaPo budget reporter Kelsey Snell: </strong>1.

Under House Republicans\u2019 plans, those <strong>tiers would disappear and</strong> <strong>the tax credits would no longer vary depending on geography.</strong> As a result, the largest credits, $4,000 for people 60 and older, would cover more than half the typical insurance premiums in New Mexico, for example, but less than a third of the cost in Wyoming.\u201d</p> <p><strong>-- Bigger picture --&gt; \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-debate-over-the-affordable-care-act-is-really-a-debate-over-wealth-redistribution/2017/03/07/36b7d048-034e-11e7-ad5b-d22680e18d10_story.html?utm_term=.6229dd8a95ac\">The debate over the Affordable Care Act is really a debate over wealth redistribution</a>,\u201d by Karen Tumulty:</strong> \u201cWhat makes the latest health-care battle different from past ones is that it is not about building a new government program.

The plan also includes the signature ACA rule prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage or charging more to people with preexisting medical conditions, which was supported by 69 percent.

Two-thirds of Americans (66 percent) in the AP-NORC poll supported expanding Medicaid to more low-income, uninsured adults \u2026 The bill would also cap the amount of federal Medicaid funding a state receives per person. \u2026 While this issue is fairly complex, a February Kaiser Family Foundation poll found roughly 32 percent of the public supported such a change, while 63 percent preferred maintaining federally guaranteed benefits.\u201d</li> </ul> <table cellpadding=\"20\" style=\"background-color:#E1E1E1;border-collapse: collapse; mso-table-lspace: 0pt; mso-table-rspace: 0pt;margin-top: 1em;\"> <tbody> <tr> <td style=\"background-color:#E1E1E1;\" bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\">Welcome to the Daily 202,<b> PowerPost's</b> morning newsletter.<br><a href=\"https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/?location=ENL&amp;method=SURL#/bundle/daily202\" style=\"color: #005b88; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word; border-bottom-color: #d4d4d4; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1px;\">Sign up to receive the newsletter.</a></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong>WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:</strong></p> <div class=\"inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-center horizontal-photo\"> <img class=\"zoom-in\" src=\"https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/1404734d449273266331469befeec4eb-908-605-Womens_Day_Philadelphia_31585d469b.jpg\"> <div class=\"pb-caption\"> Teachers take part in a \"A Day Without A Woman\" demonstration outside the Science Leadership Academy in Philadelphia this morning.

"date": "03-08-2017", "source": "new-york-times", "text": "THE BIG IDEA:\n\nAfter appearing to project some ambivalence earlier in the day, President Trump came out strongly last night for the faltering House Republican plan to replace Obamacare. He told the group of about 20 lawmakers who will be charged with whipping up support for the legislation that he wants the Paul Ryan bill to be approved largely intact. He said he plans to become personally involved in persuading wavering lawmakers. And he warned that Republicans will suffer badly in the midterms if they fail to deliver on their campaign promises to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. One member who was in the private meeting told CNN that he even spoke of an electoral \u201cbloodbath.\u201d\n\nOffering a taste of what\u2019s to come, POTUS took to Twitter a few hours later to nudge Rand Paul, a 2016 rival for the GOP nomination who is now a potentially pivotal vote in the Senate:\n\nI feel sure that my friend @RandPaul will come along with the new and great health care program because he knows Obamacare is a disaster! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 8, 2017\n\nThe Kentucky senator described the draft language, which will be marked up in committee hearings today, as \u201cObamacare Lite\u201d and pronounced it \u201cdead on arrival.\u201d\n\nThe House leadership Obamacare Lite plan has many problems. We should be stopping mandates, taxes and entitlements not keeping them. \u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) March 7, 2017\n\nThe president is also trying to use carrots, not just sticks, stepping up outreach to other 2016 foes. Tonight he\u2019s having dinner with Ted Cruz. Yesterday he lunched with Lindsey Graham. The South Carolina senator, as a gesture of goodwill, gave the president his new cell phone number. This is notable because, during a 2015 rally, Trump read Graham\u2019s old number aloud to a crowd and asked people to call him.\n\nTrump has negotiated big deals, but he\u2019s never done anything quite like this. There will be a steep learning curve. \u201cFollowing late-afternoon votes Tuesday, several Republican senators privately groused that they felt rushed by their GOP colleagues in the House and by Trump, who they said does not fully grasp the Senate\u2019s slower pace or its concerns,\u201d Mike DeBonis, Robert Costa and David Weigel report. \u201cThe senators also expressed skepticism that key White House officials with deep ties to Congress\u2019s conservative wing would eventually be able to lock up the votes for the current plan. Instead, they said there is confusion over who is managing the process and which administration figures, if any, have power to sway Trump on the issue.\u201d\n\nJust how much political capital Trump is willing to spend is an open question that could determine the fate of the 2010 law. Will he keep his tweets gentle like the one aimed at Paul last night or will they take on a harder, more personal edge? You could imagine him lashing out at leaders of Freedom Caucus on a Saturday morning, for instance, blaming them for the failure of his agenda. Perhaps the fear of drawing his ire \u2013 a credible threat based on his track record \u2013 will get some members off of the fence. There are other ways he could use his power: Would he have rallies in the states or districts of wavering lawmakers? Will his new outside group run ads promoting the bill or criticizing those who oppose him?\n\nThere\u2019s an emerging sense among some in Trump World that repeal and replace will not happen without muscular leadership from the president, but there\u2019s also a growing recognition of the political risks that come with wading in deeply. Four are top of mind:\n\nDonald Trump enters a meeting with the House Deputy Whip team in the East Room at the White House yesterday. (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\n1. RUNNING AFOUL OF CONSERVATIVES IN THE GOP CIVIL WAR:\n\nThe battle lines are drawn. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Wall Street Journal editorial board support the Ryan plan. The Koch network (led by Americans for Prosperity), the Club for Growth, FreedomWorks, Heritage Action and Breitbart vocally opposed it. People on the right have dubbed the plan \u201cObamacare Lite\u201d or \u201cRyanCare.\u201d\n\nMany of these groups opposing the draft bill have never viewed Trump as an authentic movement conservative. If they see him as joining forces with the establishment to ram through something that is tantamount to a new government entitlement, it will only bolster their skepticism. It\u2019s not out of the question that Trump will have a primary challenger from his right to contend with in three years, and this could be a data point.\n\n2. BACKLASH FROM SENIORS:\n\nSeniors constitute Trump\u2019s core base of support. Exit polls showed that the septuagenarian really ran up the score with older people vis-\u00e0-vis Mitt Romney, and this might have made the difference in several states.\n\nThe draft legislation Trump embraces would undo a rule from the ACA that allows insurers to charge their oldest customers no more than three times what they charge their youngest and healthiest ones. Insurers could now charge five times as much.\n\nAARP has already begun mobilizing its members on this point. David Certner, the senior lobby\u2019s legislative counsel, said the group is particularly concerned about the effect on Americans ages 50 to 64 if that age-charge differential is to increase. Low-income Americans in that older group would \u201cget hammered,\u201d he said, per Amy Goldstein and Juliet Eilperin.\n\nExpect to see hundreds of anecdotes like this one over the coming months: \u201cMartha Brawley of Monroe, N.C., said she voted for President Trump in the hope he could make insurance more affordable. But on Tuesday, Ms. Brawley, 55, was feeling increasingly nervous based on what she had heard about the new plan from television news reports,\u201d the New York Times reports. \u201cShe pays about $260 per month for a Blue Cross plan and receives a subsidy of $724 per month to cover the rest of her premium. Under the House plan, she would receive $3,500 a year in tax credits \u2014 $5,188 less than she gets under the Affordable Care Act. \u2018I\u2019m scared, I\u2019ll tell you that right now, to think about not having insurance at my age,\u2019 said Ms. Brawley, who underwent a liver biopsy on Monday after her doctor found that she has an autoimmune liver disease. \u2018If I didn\u2019t have insurance, these doctors wouldn\u2019t see me.\u2019\u201d\n\n3. THE 2020 FACTOR:\n\nTiming is everything in politics. If the disastrous rollout of healthcare.gov happened in Oct. 2012, instead of Oct. 2013, Obama very well might have lost reelection. Recognizing the risks of implementation, they postponed a lot of deadlines until after elections.\n\nThe most striking thing about studying the draft House bills is how much stuff comes due in 2020, when Trump has already announced he will be running for reelection and Republicans will be fighting to preserve their narrow majority in the Senate.\n\n\u201cThe changes to the Medicaid expansion and the subsidy system would take hold at the beginning of 2020,\u201d Greg Sargent observes. \u201cDemocratic candidates will be able to blast Republicans who voted for the GOP replacement, on the grounds that it is resulting in their states\u2019 residents getting tossed off of coverage, while vowing to replace the spending. Some GOP senators up for reelection in 2020 in swing states also happen to represent states that already opted into the Medicaid expansion. That includes Joni Ernst in Iowa and Cory Gardner in Colorado. There\u2019s also Thom Tillis in North Carolina (which didn\u2019t expand Medicaid but could lose a lot in subsidies). \u2018The Republican health-care plan as it stands today would certainly endanger some Republican incumbents up in 2020,\u2019 said Jennifer Duffy, who tracks Senate races at the Cook Political Report. Some of these senators got elected by campaigning against the ACA\u2019s rollout problems amid the shriveled midterm electorate of 2014 and will now face reelection in a presidential year, as repeal\u2019s impact takes hold.\u201d\n\n4. HE FULLY OWNS FAILURE:\n\nThe more aggressively he sells the bill, the more he will be identified with its collapse if things don\u2019t work out.\n\nThe margin for error is small: They can afford to lose 21 Republicans in the House and just two in the Senate. The House Freedom Caucus has about 30 members. Several of them held a press conference outside the Capitol to say they\u2019d never vote for the measure as it stands now. They ideally want straight repeal with nothing else, which is just never going to happen. In addition to Paul and Cruz, Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) opposed the House draft yesterday. If the three of them voted no, the measure would fail.\n\nBut, but, but: Every concession that\u2019s made to win over the Freedom Caucus and that trio in the Senate makes it harder to lock down the votes of someone like Susan Collins or Rob Portman. The Ohio senator who was one of four Republicans to declare this week that he\u2019ll oppose any plan that hurts lower-income folks who benefited from expanding Medicaid under the law. The others are Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), Cory Gardner (Colo.) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska).\n\nMitch McConnell said yesterday that the Senate will pass a repeal bill before Easter recess: \u201cSenior GOP sources said the leadership team will employ an \u2018arm-breaking\u2019 whip strategy to get the required 50 votes,\u201d Politico\u2019s Burgess Everett reports.\n\nThis \u201carm-breaking\u201d approach could backfire, however. One Republican senator said on background last night that several senators are asking their leadership to \u201ctake it easy\u201d in terms of the timeline, allowing space to debate and analyze the proposal with a \u201cclear understanding of the costs involved,\u201d per DeBonis, Costa and Weigel\u2019s story on the state of play. \u201cIf that takes months or a year, so be it,\u201d the senator said. A second GOP senator said the party was making a \u201cmistake\u201d in its rollout by taking \u201ctoo much ownership\u201d of health care after years in which Democrats were identified with Obamacare.\n\nMike Pence speaks to reporters after joining Senate Republicans for their weekly policy lunch yesterday. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nKEY POINT: MIKE PENCE WILL NEED TO BE THE CLOSER.\n\nThe vice president will be crucial to winning over recalcitrant House Republicans he once served with. He has credibility because he voted against Medicare Part D when the Bush White House was heavily pressuring Republicans to fall in line.\n\nPence, an Indiana talk radio host before getting elected to Congress, has several interviews scheduled this afternoon to sell what\u2019s been branded as The American Health Care Act. He\u2019ll talk to Sean Hannity for his radio show and then sit-down with local TV affiliates from Virginia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Florida.\n\nBut the VP is best at the inside game, especially compared to Trump, which is why the most important thing on Pence\u2019s calendar today is a 7 p.m. \u201clegislative affairs dinner\u201d at the Naval Observatory to schmooze lawmakers. Dave Weigel relays a telling anecdote from the Capitol yesterday: \u201cThe House Freedom Caucus was ready for the spotlight. Dozens of reporters and cameramen had set up at the House Triangle. Some cable networks were taking their news conference live. But a few reporters were being held inside the Capitol by security guards because Pence was wrapping a visit to the Hill, talking to Freedom Caucus members. When the vice president left, some of the conservative rebellion\u2019s leaders were taking a more measured \u2014 if still skeptical \u2013 stance.\u201d\n\nAs Trump embraced the specific bill, his top aides clarified that he is very open to changes and amendments to make it better. In his conversations with members yesterday, Pence stressed that the Ryan plan is \u201cthe framework for reform.\u201d OMB director Mick Mulvaney, a member of the Freedom Caucus until just a few weeks ago, carried a similar message when he went to the Hill to reassure the right flank of the conference that the president is open to amendments. \u201cThis is a work in progress and continues to be so,\u201d HHS secretary Tom Price said on Fox News last night. \u201cLet me make clear to people that this single bill is not the entire plan.\"\n\n\n\nFIVE MORE OBAMACARE STORIES FROM OUR TEAM:\n\n-- \u201cObamacare repeal guts crucial public health funds,\u201d by Lena H. Sun: \u201cThe Republican health-care bill would eliminate funds for fundamental public health programs, including for the prevention of bioterrorism and disease outbreaks, as well as money to provide immunizations and heart-disease screenings. As part of the ACA, the Prevention and Public Health Fund provides almost $1 billion annually to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 2010, the fund has been an increasingly important source of money for core CDC programs, today accounting for about 12 percent of the CDC\u2019s total budget. The GOP bill would eliminate the Prevention and Public Health Fund starting in October of next year. No clear replacement has been proposed. Cuts in those funds, combined with potential federal budget cuts at the CDC and other health agencies, \u2018could amount to a catastrophic year for public health funding,\u2019 according to a statement from the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cHere are five ways the GOP proposal would change the tax system,\u201d via WaPo budget reporter Kelsey Snell: 1. This is a major tax cut for the rich. 2. Lower-income workers are going to feel the biggest squeeze. 3. There may be more tax changes to come. 4. All of these tax changes could create a big deficit headache. 5. Democrats and even some conservatives are skeptical the math will work out in Republicans\u2019 favor.\n\n-- \u201cIncome separates the winners and losers in Republicans\u2019 health-care plans,\u201d by Amy Goldstein and Juliet Eilperin: \u201cAn analysis by S&P Global predicts the legislation would lead to a loss of coverage for 2 million to 4 million of the roughly 16 million Americans who bought their own health plans through the ACA\u2019s marketplaces or separately. More adults 35 and younger would gain coverage, while fewer adults 45 and older would be insured, according to the analysis. Specifically, the current subsidies take into account the cost of insurance in a given area, and they are linked to premiums for the next-to-lowest \u2018silver\u2019 health plan \u2014 the second rung among four ACA tiers that supply different levels of coverage. Under House Republicans\u2019 plans, those tiers would disappear and the tax credits would no longer vary depending on geography. As a result, the largest credits, $4,000 for people 60 and older, would cover more than half the typical insurance premiums in New Mexico, for example, but less than a third of the cost in Wyoming.\u201d\n\n-- Bigger picture --> \u201cThe debate over the Affordable Care Act is really a debate over wealth redistribution,\u201d by Karen Tumulty: \u201cWhat makes the latest health-care battle different from past ones is that it is not about building a new government program. This time, the question is whether to abolish one \u2026 That means it is harder to gloss over a bedrock philosophical and ideological question that has always been in the background of any argument about the government\u2019s role in health care: What is the minimum that society should provide for its poorest, most vulnerable citizens, and how much should be taken from the rich and powerful to do it? \u2018Even though it is a technical discussion, it\u2019s a really big value discussion,\u2019 said Robert Blendon, a professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard University...\n\n\u201cThere were many ways that Obamacare redistributed the burden of medical costs \u2014 from the sick to the healthy, with provisions such as the one denying insurers the ability to refuse coverage to people with preexisting conditions; from the old to the young, with a mandate that everyone have coverage or pay a penalty; from the rich to the poor, with an array of new taxes.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cThe most popular (and unpopular) parts of House Republicans\u2019 health-care plan,\u201d by WaPo polling director Scott Clement: \u201cThe Republicans' plan keeps several of the law's most popular provisions, but also scales back or repeals several others that enjoy majority support. As widely expected, the law also repeals the individual mandate to buy insurance (or pay a fine), the least popular part of the ACA.\u201d\n\nPopular parts the GOP plan keeps: \u201c The House Republicans\u2019 replacement plan preserves four parts of the ACA that at least 60 percent of adults favored keeping in a January Associated Press-NORC poll. The survey found 77 percent supported the ACA\u2019s requirement that private insurance companies offer preventive health services at no out-of-pocket cost, while 60 percent supported requiring plans to cover the full cost of birth control. The plan also includes the signature ACA rule prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage or charging more to people with preexisting medical conditions, which was supported by 69 percent. More than 70 percent supported allowing adult children up to age 26 to stay on their parents\u2019 health plans, which the GOP plan keeps.\u201d\n\nThe House Republicans\u2019 replacement plan preserves four parts of the ACA that at least 60 percent of adults favored keeping in a January Associated Press-NORC poll.

Two-thirds of Americans (66 percent) in the AP-NORC poll supported expanding Medicaid to more low-income, uninsured adults \u2026 The bill would also cap the amount of federal Medicaid funding a state receives per person. \u2026 While this issue is fairly complex, a February Kaiser Family Foundation poll found roughly 32 percent of the public supported such a change, while 63 percent preferred maintaining federally guaranteed benefits.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning newsletter.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\nTeachers take part in a \"A Day Without A Woman\" demonstration outside the Science Leadership Academy in Philadelphia this morning.

The plan puts the administration in the unusual position of trading spending on security programs for other security priorities at the southern border, raising questions among Republican lawmakers and homeland-security experts. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), who supported Trump\u2019s presidential bid and oversees the House Transportation subcommittee on the Coast Guard and maritime transportation, questioned whether OMB officials are on the same page as the White House, citing the sea service\u2019s roles in stopping illegal immigration and the flow of drugs into the country.\"\n\nUS security official on Trump budget plan: \"cuts to Coast Guard are insane.

(Peter Holley)\n\nWIKILEAKS STRIKES AGAIN:\n\n-- A vast portion of the CIA\u2019s computer hacking arsenal appears to have been exposed by WikiLeaks, which posted thousands of files revealing highly-classified CIA hacking tools used to convert cellphones, televisions and other ordinary devices into implements of espionage. Greg Miller and Ellen Nakashima report: \u201cThe trove appeared to lay bare the design and capabilities of some of the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s most closely guarded cyber weapons, a breach that will likely cause immediate damage to the CIA\u2019s efforts to gather intelligence overseas and place new strain on the U.S. government\u2019s relationship with Silicon Valley giants. ... [Officials said] the breach could undermine the CIA\u2019s ability to carry out key parts of its mission, from targeting the Islamic State and other terrorist networks to penetrating the computer defenses of sophisticated cyber adversaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like really the backbone of their network exploitation kit,\u201d said one former hacker who worked for the NSA.\n\n\"Any exposure of these tools is going to cause grave if not irreparable damage to the ability of our intelligence agencies to conduct our mission,\u201d a former senior U.S. intelligence official said.\n\n-- There is no good rationale for this disclosure: WikiLeaks claimed to have gotten the files from a former CIA contractor and touted the trove as comparable in scale and significance to the NSA leaks exposed by Edward Snowden. \"But while the Snowden files revealed massive surveillance programs that gathered data on millions of Americans, the CIA documents posted so far by WikiLeaks appear mainly to unmask hacking methods that many experts already assumed the agency had developed,\" Greg and Ellen note.\n\n-- Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s approach to WikiLeaks has taken a full 180 now that he is the one occupying the White House. Only a few months ago, he praised the organization during his rallies and once lauded it as a \u201ctreasure trove.\" Jenna Johnson and Ashley Parker report: \u201cBack then, Trump loved anything that made his rival Hillary Clinton look bad \u2014 even if the information had been hacked, stolen or leaked. But now that he is in the White House, Trump is having to confront the threat of hacking, along with leaks from within his own administration \u2014 and, suddenly, he is not a fan. Trump and his aides have angrily railed against leakers, threatening to find and prosecute them and urging congressional allies to investigate, while being uncharacteristically quiet when it comes to WikiLeaks. ... The breach could pose a serious challenge for Trump, who has been feuding with the intelligence community over probes into alleged ties between his campaign and Russia.\"\n\nFormer Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said he hopes Trump finally realizes that the hacking in the election is \u201can anti-American problem,\u201d rather than a partisan one: \u201cThe problem at its core is that a country that our own Joint Chiefs of Staff said was our greatest enemy and greatest threat to our security stole information from one of our national political parties and used it against one of the candidates,\u201d he said, referring to Russia. \u201cDo I believe that this is going to come back to haunt the Republicans? Absolutely, I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem at its core is that a country that our own Joint Chiefs of Staff said was our greatest enemy and greatest threat to our security stole information from one of our national political parties and used it against one of the candidates,\u201d he said, referring to Russia. \u201cDo I believe that this is going to come back to haunt the Republicans? Absolutely, I do.\u201d Sean Spicer declined to comment on the latest WikiLeaks dump during his press briefing, saying that the issue \u201chas not been fully evaluated.\u201d\n\nJohn McCain said that, if the group \u201ccan hack the CIA, they can hack anybody,\u201d and urged the White House to place more focus on the issue: \u201cI\u2019d like to see a greater emphasis, to tell you the truth.\"\n\n-- The mole hunt has begun. Devlin Barrett reports: \u201cIn the wake of revelations from Army private Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden, officials sought to tighten security procedures, and federal agents came under greater pressure to find and prevent secrets from spilling out of the government. But cracks keep appearing in the system. Now, U.S. intelligence agencies are [again] rushing \u2026 to determine whether they again have suffered an embarrassing compromise at the hands of one of their own. ... Once investigators verify the accuracy of the WikiLeaks documents, a key question to answer is who had access to the information, according to veterans of past leak probes.\u201d\n\nVladimir Putin marks International Women's Day at the Kremlin in Moscow a few hours ago.

(CNN)\n\n-- Trump's then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski personally approved foreign policy adviser Carter Page\u2019s now-infamous trip to Moscow last summer on the condition that he would \u201cnot be an official representative\u201d of the Trump campaign. Politico reports: \u201cA few weeks before he traveled to Moscow to give a July 7 speech, Page asked J.D. Gordon, his supervisor on the campaign\u2019s National Security Advisory Committee, for permission to make the trip, and Gordon strongly advised against it. \u2026 Page then emailed Lewandowski and spokeswoman Hope Hicks asking for formal approval, and was told by Lewandowski that he could make the trip, but not as an official representative of the campaign, the former campaign adviser said. The trip is now a focus of congressional and FBI investigations into Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election.\u201d Lewandowski said he did not recall the email exchange but \u201cdid not deny\u201d that it occurred. \u201cIs it possible that he emailed me asking if he could go to Russia as a private citizen?\u201d Lewandowski said Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t remember that, but I probably got 1,000 emails a day at that time \u2026 And I wouldn\u2019t necessarily remember if I had a one-word response to him saying he could do something as a private citizen.\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s nominee for deputy attorney general declined to endorse Democratic calls for a special prosecutor to investigate Russia\u2019s election interference during his confirmation hearing. Matt Zapotosky, Sari Horwitz and Sean Sullivan report: \u201cUnder insistent questioning from Democrats, deputy attorney general nominee Rod J. Rosenstein refused to commit Tuesday to appoint a special counsel to oversee investigations of Russian meddling \u2026 though he stressed that he did not yet know the facts of the matter. At a tense Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing that lasted more than 3 1/2 hours, Rosenstein said that he was \u2018not aware\u2019 of any reason he would not be able to supervise such probes. \u201cYou view it as an issue of principle, that I need to commit to appoint a special counsel in a matter that I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s being investigated,\u201d he told Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who had vowed to try to block his nomination should he not make such a commitment. \u201cAnd I view it as an issue of principle that as a nominee for deputy attorney general, I should not be promising to take action on a particular case.\u201d\n\n-- Al Franken says he has concluded that Attorney General Jeff Sessions definitely committed perjury during his confirmation hearing when he failed to disclose his meetings with the Russian ambassador. \"It's hard to come to any other conclusion than he just perjured himself,\" the Minnesota Democrat said on CNN, telling host Jake Tapper that Sessions should come before the Senate Judiciary Committee again to explain himself.\n\n-- Christopher Steele, the former British spy who authored the controversial dossier on Trump, which was widely circulated and eventually sent him and his family into hiding, has reemerged. London journalists said he was spotted outside his company\u2019s building on Tuesday, appearing relaxed \u2013 albeit tight-lipped -- about his recent whereabouts. \"I'm now going to be focusing my efforts on supporting the broader interests of our company here,\u201d Steele told reporters. \u201cI'd like to say a warm thank you to everyone who sent me kind messages and support over the last few weeks,\u201d he added.

The Daily Beast\u2019s Tim Mak reports: \u201cIn March 2014, the U.S. government sanctioned Dmitry Rogozin\u2014a hardline deputy to [Putin], the head of Russia\u2019s defense industry and longtime opponent of American power\u2014 in retaliation for the invasion of Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. Eighteen months later, the [NRA], Trump\u2019s most powerful outside ally during the 2016 election, sent a delegation to Moscow that met with him. David Keene, the former NRA president and current board member who was on the Moscow trip, insisted the meeting \u2026. had nothing whatsoever to do with geopolitics. But Rogozin is no ordinary Russian official, and his title extends far beyond being merely the chairman of a shooting club. His portfolio as deputy prime minister of Russia includes the defense industry. One issue where Rogozin seems particularly interested is cyberwarfare, which he has heralded for its \u2018first strike\u2019 capability.\u201d\n\nBarack Obama leaves the National Gallery of Art in Washington on Sunday.

Lee and Peter Nicholas report: \u201cThe budding feud between two men who share the unique bond of membership in the commander-in-chiefs\u2019 club is a fresh distraction in a Trump presidency that has been struggling to enact its agenda. The rift also is distancing Mr. Trump from a former two-term president who had offered to give private advice and counsel as the onetime businessman settles into his first job in public office.\u201d\n\n-- The New York Times\u2019 Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman report on the turmoil Trump\u2019s tweets often create among his closest circles: \u201c[His Saturday tweet, for example], led to a succession of frantic staff conference calls, including one consultation with the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, as staff members grasped the reality that the president had opened an attack on his predecessor. Mr. Trump, advisers said, was in high spirits after he fired off the posts. But by midafternoon, after returning from golf, he appeared to realize he had gone too far, although he still believed Mr. Obama had wiretapped him.\u201d He reportedly asked staff about hiring someone on the outside to try corroborating his claims.\n\n-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said he has not seen any evidence supporting Trump\u2019s claim that he had been \u201cwiretapped\u201d by the Obama administration, but said his committee would \u201clook into it anyway.\u201d Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201cThe bigger question that needs to be answered is whether or not Mr. Trump or any of his associates were in fact targeted by any of the intelligence agencies or law enforcement authorities,\u201d Nunes told reporters Tuesday. \u201cAt this point we don\u2019t have any evidence of that,\u201d Nunes said. \u201cBut we also don\u2019t have any evidence of many people who have been named in multiple news stories that supposedly are under some type of investigation.\u201d\n\nRanking committee Democrat Adam B.

In addition to this week\u2019s gathering of 600 attendees \u2026 the group has booked two upcoming meetings, in September and again in 2018, at the Trump International Hotel down the street from the White House\u2026\n\n\u201cAt the same time, the organization, representing candy titans Hershey, Mars and Jelly Belly, among other companies, is optimistic about scoring big, early policy wins from the Trump administration. Among the industry\u2019s priorities: a long-sought rollback of government sugar subsidies that candy firms say drive up the costs of making their products. The group said it booked the venues in 2014 and 2015, long before Trump won the presidency. But the arrangement illustrates a repercussion of Trump\u2019s decision to retain ownership of his business during his time in the White House \u2014 that he can become financially intertwined with a special interest that is simultaneously seeking to influence policy decisions by his administration.\u201d\n\nBoris Epshteyn, White House Assistant Communications Director for Surrogate Operations, huddles with Omarosa, the White House Director of Communications for the Office of Public Liaison.

Epshteyn\u2019s rise to a position of prominence in the Trump White House reveals how the president has rewarded his loyalists.
