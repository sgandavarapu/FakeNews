Whether or not Trump is aware of this plan cannot yet be proven, but as I have mentioned in the past, his cabinet of Goldman Sachs alumni and neo-con veterans hardly gives me confidence.\u00c2\u00a0 In the best-case scenario, Trump is surrounded by enemies; in the worst-case scenario, he is surrounded by friends.</p><p>Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loyalties, though, are a secondary issue for now.\u00c2\u00a0 The primary focus of this article is to discern whether or not a battle between Trump and the Fed will result in a net positive or a net negative for the public.\u00c2\u00a0 My position is that any action against the Fed should have happened years ago, and that today, the Fed is nothing more than a sacrificial appendage of a greater globalist agenda.\u00c2\u00a0 Meaning, conservative groups should be aware that a victory over the Fed is not actually a victory over the globalists.\u00c2\u00a0 In fact, the globalists may very well WANT a war between the Fed and the White House at this time.</p><p>First, some facts need to be established to counter the propaganda claims that the Fed is some kind of\u00c2\u00a0 innocent victim of a rampaging President Trump or \u00e2\u0080\u009cmisguided\u00e2\u0080\u009d conservative rhetoric.</p><p>The latest extension of the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s propaganda has been initiated, of course, by the mainstream media and liberals in general; you know, the same people that were applauding the (in some cases misguided) efforts of the Occupy Wall Street movement.\u00c2\u00a0 With Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s negation of the Dodd-Frank Act, the media has been looking for any opportunity to assert that Trump is either acting to enrich his corporate friends or that he is an idiot man-child when it comes to matters of business and economics.</p><p>This led to some sniping by Elizabeth Warren and <span class=\"example\">Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen\u2019</span>s testimony before Congress last week.\u00c2\u00a0 The argument?\u00c2\u00a0 That Trump was wrong or \u00e2\u0080\u009clying\u00e2\u0080\u009d when he said that Dodd-Frank had frozen loans from major banks.\u00c2\u00a0 You can see the glee in media outlets over the stab; <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/02/janet-yellen-just-fact-shamed-donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\">a recent article</a> by <em>Vanity Fair</em>, which seemed to focus more on snide ankle biting of Trump than concrete evidence, is a perfect example.</p><p>Now, in Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defense (or at least, in defense of his position), Yellen is actually the one lying, here.\u00c2\u00a0 While it is true that commercial lending has expanded, her claim that small business loans have improved is simply false.\u00c2\u00a0 Even <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-02-03/one-way-for-trump-to-help-small-business\"> Bloomberg begrudgingly acknowledges</a> that small business loans have fallen by at least 6% since the passage of Dodd-Frank.\u00c2\u00a0 In Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favorite liberal home-base, Chicago, loans to small neighborhood businesses <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/columnists/ct-small-business-loans-robert-reed-0205-biz-20170202-column.html\">declined by 49%</a> between 2008 and 2014.</p><p>In 2015, Yellen herself argued that small business loans were in decline because small business owners \u00e2\u0080\u009c<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/02/26/small-biz-lending-tktkt-.html\" target=\"_blank\">don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want loans anymore.</a>\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 This is a bit like the Bureau of Labor Statistics arguing that over 95 million unemployed working age Americans should not be counted as unemployed in their stats because they really \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want a job.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 It is an attempt to muddy the waters on the greater issue, which is that the U.S. economy is in considerable danger.</p><p>You see, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think Trump was debating that major corporations and banks were not receiving ample loans, I think he was primarily pointing out the disparity in small business loans and personal loans.\u00c2\u00a0 Yellen and the mainstream media attempted to use one data point \u00e2\u0080\u0094 commercial loans, to dismiss the entire debate over loan stagnation.</p><p>The fact is, we all KNOW that major corporations and banks have been flooded with ample loans, and much of this capital was conjured out of thin air by the Fed itself through fiat creation and near zero interest rates.\u00c2\u00a0 We know this because of the <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-buybacks-analysis-idUSKCN0RN0D320150923\" target=\"_blank\">$16 trillion in loans</a> made to companies around the world exposed by the revealing (but limited) TARP audit.\u00c2\u00a0 We also know this because much of these loans have been used to inflate the stock market bubble for the past few years through <a href=\"http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2013/12/18/feds-low-rates-may-be-juicing-stock-buybacks-at-the-expense-of-jobs/\" target=\"_blank\">endless stock buybacks</a> that most companies never would have been able to afford otherwise. We also know that the mainstream investment world is aware of the importance of these loans because they started to panic as the Fed announced its ongoing program of interest rate hikes.</p><p>Beyond that, we know that the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s low interest loans and culture of circular inbred lending between corporations and banks have been instrumental in keeping stocks hyperinflated, because Fed officials have OPENLY ADMITTED that this is the case.\u00c2\u00a0 As Richard Fisher of the Dallas Fed stated in an <a href=\"http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000474362\" target=\"_blank\">interview with CNBC</a>:</p><p><strong>What the Fed did \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and I was part of that group \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is we front-loaded a tremendous market rally, starting in 2009. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sort of what I call the \u00e2\u0080\u009creverse Wimpy factor\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 give me two hamburgers today for one tomorrow. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not surprised that almost every index you can look at \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 was down significantly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Referring to the results in the stock market after the Fed raised rates in December 2015.]</strong></p><p><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u00a6I was warning my colleagues, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go wobbly if we have a 10-20 percent correction at some point. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Everybody you talk to \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 has been warning that these markets are heavily priced.</strong></p><p>So, again, the issue is not whether or not banks are lending, we know they are lending, they just aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lending to the people that need it most.</p><p><a href=\"http://activistpost.net/backyardliberty.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\"

the consequences of the Fed bubble and that a 10% to 20% drop in equities is an absurd underestimation.\u00c2\u00a0 But setting aside the \u201clittle white lies,\u201d it is at least widely available knowledge that the Federal Reserve initiated a corporate loan free-for-all, knowing that the supposed benefits were limited in scope as well as in duration.\u00c2\u00a0 They know that a crash is coming, and they have been stalling until they can find the right scapegoat to divert blame.\u00c2\u00a0 That scapegoat is Trump, and by association, all conservatives.</p><p>As far as Dodd-Frank is concerned, the act was supposed to be a primer for stopping destructive behavior in the financial sector, more specifically in derivatives.\u00c2\u00a0 Yet, in spite of Dodd-Frank, banks like Citigroup are STILL <a href=\"http://wallstreetonparade.com/2016/07/citigroup-has-more-derivatives-than-4701-u-s-banks-combined-after-blowing-itself-up-with-derivatives-in-2008/\" target=\"_blank\">bloated with derivatives </a>after receiving at least $476 billion in taxpayer funds to stop them from going bankrupt for the very same irresponsibility.</p><p>Dodd-Frank accomplished absolutely nothing in terms of what it was mandated to do.\u00c2\u00a0 I believe the only true purpose of Dodd-Frank was to distract everyone from Ron Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fed audit bill, which was gaining major traction at the time.</p><p>So, why does Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s undercutting of Dodd-Frank even matter?\u00c2\u00a0 As outlined above, it is a propaganda point for the establishment to perpetuate the narrative that Trump is incompetent, that the people who support him are incompetent, and that when the economy does shift into greater crisis it will be his fault and the fault of conservatives.\u00c2\u00a0 It is also a springboard for the Federal Reserve to \u00e2\u0080\u009cattack\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump, as shown in Yellen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s congressional testimony.</p><p>I also find it interesting that through the Dodd-Frank issue as well as others, Leftists are being galvanized in support around the Federal Reserve, something that they probably would not have done a couple of years ago.\u00c2\u00a0 This is all culminating in what I believe will become a titanic battle not only between Trump and Leftists, but also between Donald Trump and the Fed.\u00c2\u00a0 But why would the establishment want to incite a conflict between the president and the central bank?</p><p>This is something conservatives and liberty activists have wanted for decades \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a president that would be willing to take on the Federal Reserve and expose its innards.\u00c2\u00a0 The problem is, the time for the effectiveness of such an action is long gone.\u00c2\u00a0 Auditing the Fed under Obama (an openly pro-globalist president) would have been a disaster for the powers that be.\u00c2\u00a0 It would have thrown their entire agenda into disarray and killed any chance that they could complete what they call the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreat global economic reset.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Auditing or shutting down the Fed under Trump is another matter.</p><p>As I examined in detail with evidence in my article<a href=\"http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2403-the-economic-end-game-explained\"> \u2018The Economic End Game Explained\u2019</a>, the Federal Reserve has a shelf life.\u00c2\u00a0 It has already served its purpose, which was to undermine the American economy and our currency system.\u00c2\u00a0 The Fed will now begin deflating the bubbles it has engineered in stocks, Treasuries and the dollar through continued interest rate hikes and rolling out the over $4 trillion (official amount) on its balance sheet.\u00c2\u00a0 The goal?\u00c2\u00a0 Sinking America and reducing it to third world status over the course of the next several years to make way for total global centralization of economic administration, eventually leading to global fiscal management under the IMF and perhaps the BIS, and a global currency system; all while making conservative movements look like the monster behind the crisis.</p><p>To summarize, the U.S. economy and the dollar are slated for a controlled demolition.\u00c2\u00a0 The Fed will do everything in its power to prod Trump and conservatives into war with the central bank, because the Fed is now ready to sacrifice itself and the dollar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world reserve status in order to clear a path for a new global system and ideology. The Federal Reserve is a suicide bomber.</p><p>If this takes place as I predict then the international banks and the establishment elites will be able to lay the blame for the death of king dollar squarely at the feet of Trump and conservatives, and at least a third of the country (leftists) will buy into the narrative lock, stock and barrel because they desperately WANT to believe it.\u00c2\u00a0 Remember, the tale being scripted here is that Trump is a rampaging maniac that does not know what he is doing.</p><p><a href=\"http://activistpost.net/familysurvival.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ecN3sqsXbAo/UCFiDlqShKI/AAAAAAAAROc/NULHbWS2zB4/s200/4.gif\"/></a>To be clear, I am not supporting the continuing dominance of the Fed, or the existence of the fiat dollar.\u00c2\u00a0 What I am saying is that conservatives may just get what we have been wishing for all these years but not in the manner we had hoped.</p><p>To counter this threat our list of targets must expand to meet reality.\u00c2\u00a0 The delusion that the core problem is the Federal Reserve must stop.\u00c2\u00a0 The Fed is a box store, a franchise in a chain of franchises, nothing more.\u00c2\u00a0 If we do not also turn our scrutiny and aggression towards root globalist institutions like the IMF and the BIS as well as international banks, then our efforts will only serve to bolster the enemy we are trying to fight.</p><p>In a battle limited to Trump versus the Fed, only the bankers will win.</p><p><em><strong>You can read more from Brandon Smith at his site <a href=\"http://www.alt-market.com\">Alt-Market.com</a>.
