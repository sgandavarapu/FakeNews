      "\n",
      "Trump’s term will last less than 200 days—the second shortest ever. He will be replaced by Vice President Mike Pence.\n",
      "\n",
      "By Ronald L. Feinman\n",
      "\n",
      "PENCE IS PREDICTED TO OUST TRUMP ANY TIME SOON\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The news of the forced resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, due to the scandal that he, as a private citizen, spoke to the Russian ambassador in December after President Barack Obama issued sanctions on Russia for their aggressive behavior, has rocked the Donald Trump Presidency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump, already under fire by many conservatives and Republicans for his “bromance” with Russian President Vladimir Putin, is suspect as to his loyalty to traditional American foreign policy, as a result of him having hired Flynn in the first place. Critics had observed that Flynn seemed unreliable and had poor judgment. Former colleagues darkly joked that there were “Flynn facts,” a reference to his penchant for making up stuff. Flynn had also been criticized for being too close to Putin. At the Republican convention he joined in a chorus of “Lock her up,” a reference to Hillary Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many foreign policy professionals are shaking their head at Trump’s inappropriate behavior and language every time he speaks in public, or issues a Twitter comment, and his instability and recklessness. His having a security meeting over the North Korean missile test in public space at dinner in full vision of other guests is a sign of his failure to act responsibly. His abrupt ending of a phone call to the Australian Prime Minister, our loyal ally in four wars in the past hundred years, is alarming. His inconsistent message in his dealings with China, first indicating he accepted the idea of two Chinas, and then backing off under pressure, is disturbing. His inconsistency on the two-state solution in the Middle East is a major problem, as is his seeming lack of respect for Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel, and lack of strong support for NATO.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that Vice President Mike Pence played a major role in pushing Flynn out is a sign that Pence is already asserting himself with Trump, and it seems clear that Pence will not stand by and allow our foreign policy to be damaged, or our national security to be endangered. The American people, ultimately, would not expect anything less.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mike Pence is an establishment Republican, with 12 years in the House of Representatives, where he served in a leadership position as Republican Conference Chairman in his last four years in the House before running for Governor of Indiana. Pence is a no-nonsense, hard-nosed Republican whose strong Christian convictions have shaped his politics, including his stands on women’s issues, gay and lesbian matters, and his refusal to accept the concept of global warming. His stands on these and other issues alienated moderate Republicans in his state. His poll numbers were low when Donald Trump picked him for vice president. Many doubted Pence would have been able to win a second term as governor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pence knows how to play “hard ball” and it is clear by his demeanor and body language that he is often uncomfortable with Trump’s freewheeling and careless behavior. An investigation into the Flynn matter will develop, with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell promoting it. Additionally, Senators John Cornyn of Texas, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and John McCain of Arizona all are pushing for hearings. As the FBI investigates this situation further, which would be expected to occur as a normal procedure after such a high level and immediate scandal, the earliest ever in any Presidential term (25 days), there will be calls for Trump to resign or be impeached.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pence will have the difficult job of defending Trump in public appearances, but can be expected to work behind the scenes to insure that Trump stabilizes his utterances and actions, particularly on foreign policy and national security matters. Pence faces now a situation that has some similarity to Gerald Ford under Richard Nixon during a time of trouble and controversy, and the possibility of future Congressional action against Donald Trump if his mental behavior continues to disturb the top leadership of the Republican Party and the foreign policy establishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "As this author wrote on January 22 on History News Network, Pence could, even if Trump vehemently opposed it, invoke the 25th Amendment, Section 4 with the approval of a majority of the cabinet, which would make Pence “Acting President.” Some might call it a “palace coup” but Pence could make a convincing case that it is too risky to leave Trump in power. Pence faces a great burden, and whether one agrees with his own agenda on domestic and foreign policy, it seems clear that the Vice President would do what he feels compelled to do if the situation further deteriorates. One would imagine that if such a scenario occurred, that Donald Trump would resign, as Richard Nixon did in 1974 after the House Judiciary Committee approved his impeachment. But with an unhinged person such as Trump, who can say what would happen in such a circumstance?\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, it seems likely that Donald Trump will be leaving the Presidency at some point, likely between the 31 days of William Henry Harrison in 1841 (dying of pneumonia) and the 199 days of James A. Garfield in 1881 (dying of an assassin’s bullet after 79 days of terrible suffering and medical malpractice). At the most, it certainly seems likely, even if dragged out, that Trump will not last 16 months and 5 days, as occurred with Zachary Taylor in 1850 (dying of a digestive ailment). The Pence Presidency seems inevitable.\n",

      "<p>Trump, already under fire by many conservatives and Republicans for his “bromance” with Russian President Vladimir Putin, is suspect as to his loyalty to traditional American foreign policy, as a result of him having hired Flynn in the first place. Critics had observed that Flynn seemed unreliable and had poor judgment. Former colleagues darkly joked that there were “Flynn facts,” a reference to his penchant for making up stuff. Flynn had also been criticized for being too close to Putin. At the Republican convention he joined in a chorus of “Lock her up,” a reference to Hillary Clinton.</p>\n",
      "<p>Many foreign policy professionals are shaking their head at Trump’s inappropriate behavior and language every time he speaks in public, or issues a Twitter comment, and his instability and recklessness. His having a security meeting over the North Korean missile test in public space at dinner in full vision of other guests is a sign of his failure to act responsibly. His abrupt ending of a phone call to the Australian Prime Minister, our loyal ally in four wars in the past hundred years, is alarming. His inconsistent message in his dealings with China, first indicating he accepted the idea of two Chinas, and then backing off under pressure, is disturbing. His inconsistency on the two-state solution in the Middle East is a major problem, as is his seeming lack of respect for Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel, and lack of strong support for NATO.</p>\n",
      "<blockquote><p><strong>The fact that Vice President Mike Pence played a major role in pushing Flynn out is a sign that Pence is already asserting himself with Trump, and it seems clear that Pence will not stand by and allow our foreign policy to be damaged, or our national security to be endangered. The American people, ultimately, would not expect anything less.</strong></p></blockquote>\n",
      "<p>Mike Pence is an establishment Republican, with 12 years in the House of Representatives, where he served in a leadership position as Republican Conference Chairman in his last four years in the House before running for Governor of Indiana. Pence is a no-nonsense, hard-nosed Republican whose strong Christian convictions have shaped his politics, including his stands on women’s issues, gay and lesbian matters, and his refusal to accept the concept of global warming. His stands on these and other issues alienated moderate Republicans in his state. His poll numbers were low when Donald Trump picked him for vice president. Many doubted Pence would have been able to win a second term as governor.</p>\n",
      "<p>Pence knows how to play “hard ball” and it is clear by his demeanor and body language that he is often uncomfortable with Trump’s freewheeling and careless behavior. An investigation into the Flynn matter will develop, with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell promoting it. Additionally, Senators John Cornyn of Texas, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and John McCain of Arizona all are pushing for hearings. As the FBI investigates this situation further, which would be expected to occur as a normal procedure after such a high level and immediate scandal, the earliest ever in any Presidential term (25 days), there will be calls for Trump to resign or be impeached.</p>\n",
      "<p>Pence will have the difficult job of defending Trump in public appearances, but can be expected to work behind the scenes to insure that Trump stabilizes his utterances and actions, particularly on foreign policy and national security matters. Pence faces now a situation that has some similarity to Gerald Ford under Richard Nixon during a time of trouble and controversy, and the possibility of future Congressional action against Donald Trump if his mental behavior continues to disturb the top leadership of the Republican Party and the foreign policy establishment.</p>\n",
      "<blockquote><p><strong>As this author wrote on January 22 on History News Network, Pence could, even if Trump vehemently opposed it, invoke the 25th Amendment, Section 4 with the approval of a majority of the cabinet, which would make Pence “Acting President.” Some might call it a “palace coup” but Pence could make a convincing case that it is too risky to leave Trump in power. </strong></p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Pence faces a great burden, and whether one agrees with his own agenda on domestic and foreign policy, it seems clear that the Vice President would do what he feels compelled to do if the situation further deteriorates.</strong></p>\n",
      "<p><strong>One would imagine that if such a scenario occurred, that Donald Trump would resign, as Richard Nixon did in 1974 after the House Judiciary Committee approved his impeachment. But with an unhinged person such as Trump, who can say what would happen in such a circumstance?</strong></p></blockquote>\n",
      "<p>In any case, it seems likely that Donald Trump will be leaving the Presidency at some point, likely between the 31 days of William Henry Harrison in 1841 (dying of pneumonia) and the 199 days of James A. Garfield in 1881 (dying of an assassin’s bullet after 79 days of terrible suffering and medical malpractice). At the most, it certainly seems likely, even if dragged out, that Trump will not last 16 months and 5 days, as occurred with Zachary Taylor in 1850 (dying of a digestive ailment). The Pence Presidency seems inevitable.</p>\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t<p>Awww, come on, PLEASE, this is a very flawed and I-wish-I-may-I-wish-I-might article. Weak, weak, weak cut-and-paste logic. Dang, it is not even very creative.</p>\n",
      "<p>I totally agree with Lobro, Trump is much smarter than he is given credit for. In fact, he is so smart, many people are bubbling with jealousy and hatred about it. Too bad. The idea is for you to learn from people who know more and learn to APPRECIATE what they have to offer and learn a thing or two or three&#8230;.etc&#8230;.</p>\n",
      "<p>So, the idea that Trump will be around only 200 days is nonsense. Trump will make it through two terms and then pass it over to Pence who will continue to prune the bushes and make America flourish, again.</p>\n",
      "<p>What is puzzling to me (well, not really I KNOW why) is that so many people want him to fail and turn the country over to the Rothschild-Soros-Frankfurt-School coven. Who is their right mind could, after having thoroughly studied these vile, traitors-against-humanity and their long-term agenda of squeeze-release-squeeze-release-squeeze-release to strangle the world), would not dedicate themselves to crushing this scum, is beyond me. Then, again, I am never presumptive of people&#8217;s inabilities OR abilities.</p>\n",
      "<p>The solution is simple. The Rothschild-Soros-Frankfurt-School-ZIonists coven live lives based on &#8220;digits&#8221;&#8230;..one-for-you-eight-for-me&#8230;.when we FINALLY take that away, life on this planet will be better and perhaps humans can raise their levels of consciousness&#8230;..which is simple, simple, simple. Just ask those who really &#8220;know&#8221;.</p>\n",
      "<p>I had a very profound experience take place at mass on Sunday. It is a great example of the Holy Spirit at work. As the congregation got up and sang the prayer of St. Francis and the cantor in the choir was leading the way, whomever was playing the organ was NOT playing the correct &#8220;sharps-and-flats&#8221; and it was a perfect example of &#8220;dis-chord&#8221;. As we struggled to sing a song we know and love and live by, the person playing the accompanying instrument was confusing the whole process and the song &amp; the message by playing the wrong notes through the whole song and in it sank into confusion and disarray. BUT, the congregation kept singing till the end as we raised our voices enough to make the organist stop playing. Lordy!</p>\n",
      "<p>So, I pondered, is this not how our lives are today, when, as  we try to do the right thing, there is a deafening pull upon us&#8230;.trying to lead us into dis-chord and trying to &#8220;drown or voices out&#8221;? And we can see this in our world by just looking at the the long-term plan and confusion precipitated by the Rothschild-Soros-Bolsevik-Zionist-Frankfurt School-Commie-Socialists in their desire to create dis-chord and enslave people. That is NOT the solution. What IS the solution is to assist people to reach their true potential by nurturing individual rights and offering practical environments and great mentoring to help people reach their true potential. If we do NOT do this, then we are nothing but two-bit propaganda organisms. I see Trump and Pence being two people who are strong enough to fight back and make this a better world. And I am talking about an &#8220;overview&#8221; and staying out of the befuddling minutia, so beautifully orchestrated and played by the discorded messaging of the media and its beloved &#8220;fake news&#8221;.

      "<p>Anyway, Trump is ringing true by keeping things and his message simple. You can see it in his methodology. People who work with him are having a hard time keeping up (aka Paul Ryan) because he is focused on accomplishing our objectives and not weighing down the processes with multiple-convoluted agendas. He works at a totally different speed because he was not to live and work like a politician and/or civil servant. I like the phrase I&#8217;ve heard, the he &#8220;works at the speed of business and not politics.</p>\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t<p>&#8220;The news of the forced resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, due to the scandal that he, as a private citizen, spoke to the Russian ambassador in December after President Barack Obama issued sanctions on Russia for their aggressive behavior, has rocked the Donald Trump Presidency.&#8221;</p>\n",
      "<p>So, a minor legal technicality has &#8220;ROCKED&#8221; the &#8220;Trump&#8221; administration, but the apparent fact that Obama wasn&#8217;t even legally eligible to hold the office of president in the first place meant absolutely nothing. Funny that.</p>\n",
      "<p>Moreover, Obama, the most illegitimate &#8220;president&#8221; the U.S. ever had, basically spent his whole &#8220;presidency&#8221; challenging the legitimacy of everyone else, e.g.,  Chavez, Maduro, Gaddafi, al-Assad, Putin, Yanukovych, etc.</p>\n",
      "<p>And from what I hear, illegal alien and former presidential poseur Obama &#8211; after having done everything he could to &#8220;sabotage&#8221; the incoming president &#8211; is now supposedly working with Soros to undermine the &#8220;Trump&#8221; administration.</p>\n",
      "<p>Isn&#8217;t it illegal to forge a birth certificate? Isn&#8217;t it a federal crime to &#8220;knowingly produce, transfer, or possess false identification documents with the intent to defraud the United States&#8221; (False Identification Crime Control Act of 1982)? Didn&#8217;t &#8220;Sheriff Joe&#8221; already do all the work to prove that Obama&#8217;s birth certificate is a fraud? </p>\n",
      "<p>Obama, who lives in a glass house, loves to throw stones; and he&#8217;s apparently still throwing them. Why doesn&#8217;t Trump prosecute &#8220;deep state&#8221; poster boy Obama, or at least brandish the threat? Is &#8220;Trump&#8221; is so weak and powerless he can&#8217;t do anything about it, even though much of the investigative work is already done? If so, I&#8217;m afraid I have to agree with the author.</p>\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t<p>A hypothetical question( I hope). If Trump is removed from office as per this article, what are the American Trump supporters going to do about it? Take up arms? Start another civil war? If you are so eager for Trump to succeed then NOW is the time for you to act. Firing off angry posts on message boards won&#8217;t cut it, I&#8217;m afraid. Trump is facing the full fury of a colour revolution. While he is personally combative in his press conferences, many of his Cabinet are not. So to those Trump Americans venting your ire on this message board, get cracking; institute impeachment proceedings against the traitors in congress via petitions etc. Organise a nationwide petition, or even a civil suit in court, to have Soros stripped of his US citizenship. There are legal grounds to do so. Remember that little matter of his helping confiscate Jewish property in Hungary? Correct me if I&#8217;m wrong but aren&#8217;t there are laws in the US to strip nazi collaborators of their citizenship and repatriate them to their country of origin? That would be lovely, hoisting the Jew on his own petard!!</p>\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t<p>Criticize, criticize, criticize&#8230;. non stop.  You see what I mean.  It&#8217;s all speculation.  How does this man know what Trump is thinking of Pence?  How does this man know anything about what went on with Trump and Putin&#8230; ?  And notice that the criticism never circles back to what Hillary did with the Russians, which was far worse.  She took money for the Clinton Foundation in return for selling off a good portion of the uranium to the U.S.  With Flynn we&#8217;re talking about a &#8220;conversation&#8221;  wow.   And if the same &#8220;conversation&#8221; standard were applied to half of Congress and half the advisers in Washington they would all be in jail?  So you see it all amounts to a big pile of nothing and yet it has power because it is coming from the powerful Jewish corner of the society&#8230;I&#8217;m assuming this guy is Jewish.   Now where would the Jewish Frankfurt School have learned the critical theory.  Maybe they learned it from their Jewish mothers who could criticize with a mere glance.  I remember my mother-in-law who was a master criticizer from the old school&#8211;I mean the Eastern European Jewish pre-war block.   So, she hasn&#8217;t seen my husband in at least 10 months and he walks in the door and she says.  Why the beard, why the cowboy boots, have you become a cowboy?  Why this?  Why that?

      "<p>I am more optimistic than you, but I know we have a very big problem.  Trump has to cut some more in his administration so that he can more freely go after the blackmailers who are also Republican&#8230; and I don&#8217;t have too much hope that he can dismantle what you call the Pharisee coup.</p>\n",
      "<p>Still, I don&#8217;t remember the relentless criticism being turned on either Obama or Hillary.  I am talking about criticism as a weapon, criticism that is groundless and unrelenting, and that allows for no exceptions.  It&#8217;s a blizzard, a white out, a chaos making type of criticism.</p>\n",
      "<p>One more antidote, just to make a point.   My mother in law lived in New York and would come to visit once a year with a suitcase of frozen food because she wouldn&#8217;t eat in my house since I was too &#8220;treif&#8221; , that is non-kosher, although my mother-in-law was not religious and actually disliked Jews although she only knew Jews so she basically disliked everyone she knew.  So&#8230; one year she is coming for Passover and I go to a deli and get very fancy Passover food to have a Seder.   She arrives from her hotel with her normal look of disgust on her face, but once we sat down for the Seder meal she went into flip out mode.  What is this, she screams, have you people turned into Lubovitchers?     That ended that&#8230;   Basically, this is a pathological level of criticism where the criticizer never looks in the mirror and yet never stops from the barrage of negative commentary.  We see this with the ten commandments of political correctness, the first being that &#8220;thou shalt never criticize Jews.&#8221;   But they get to criticize you until your civilization is dead.</p>\n",

      "<p>The so-called &#8220;deficit&#8221; is a half-truth. There is no (overall) deficit. There is actually a large (accumulated) surplus. Think of the annual deficit as your chequing account balance and the accumulated surplus as your savings account balance. Jews don&#8217;t lend money (even if it&#8217;s made from thin air) to people if they don&#8217;t have any assets or money to pay them back: this is basic Jew Scam 101.</p>\n",
      "<p>In Metro-Vancouver where I live, I discovered an enormous provincial surplus. My estimate is 66 BILLION dollars, not including the crown corporation&#8217;s &#8220;investment portfolios.&#8221; I discovered all this by simply looking at the Annual Reports of each municipality. </p>\n",
      "<p>In the US it&#8217;s called the CAFR (A Comprehensive Annual Financial Report). CAFR is a set of U.S. government financial statements comprising the financial report of a state, municipal or other governmental entity that complies with the accounting requirements promulgated by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB).</p>\n",
      "<p>FYI, I&#8217;ve recently filed a Human Rights Complaint against Christy Clark, the Premier of British Columbia, for her Bill 28 which targets overseas Chinese buyers by making them pay an extra 15% surtax on the purchase of any residential property in Metro-Vancouver. This Human Rights Complaint, in and of itself, will not be of interest to Darkmooners and White Nationalists, of course. </p>\n",
      "<p>However, please note that I made a deliberate point of highlighting the huge provincial surplus which totally destroys Ms Clark&#8217;s argument that the province does not have enough money to build affordable or socialized housing for the poor and needy, and hence the reason for her Bill 28, or so we were told.</p>\n",
      "<p>The &#8220;deficit&#8221; scam is a big part of the phony FED and money-from-thin-air scam of the Jew Banksters. As far as I know, I am probably the first person in Canada or anywhere, for that matter, to expose this fake &#8220;deficit&#8221; scam in a court of law, albeit in a Human Rights Court or rather Tribunal.</p>\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t<p>No.. Pat&#8230; I lived in the Sixties and it was not way worse.  We didn&#8217;t have a generation of profoundly sick children in the Sixties, while now we have 1 in 60 children with autism, and 1 in 21 boys, in a couple of years it could be 50 percent.  What are we going to do as a society when 50% of the people are autistic?     We have a Child Protective Services that takes kids from their parents to get paid off my the government.   Taking kids from their parents was not a money making enterprise under JFK.   Art shows now are called  spirit cooking events.  Cakes are made in the form of a corpse and guests sit around a table with actors playing decapitated heads and everyone watches as half naked men take long knives and cut limbs and genitals out of the cake and then everyone eats, and has a great time.   I can&#8217;t imagine that happening in the Sixties.  Also,  it may make us laugh but it&#8217;s not really that funny that an interviewer on a California beach asks random people what they think of the Trump boys hunting dinosaurs in Africa.  He shows a fake picture of the Trump brothers next to a dead dinosaur.  People are shocked because dinosaurs are &#8220;an endangered species.&#8221;  The same interviewer tells people that Bernie Sanders is thinking of having Bernie Madoff as his VP and the ticket would be Bernie and Bernie, and people said they thought it was a good idea, it had a nice ring.  In other words, the level of stupidity has reached epic proportions&#8211;beyond belief.  I&#8217;m glad you are optimistic.  Maybe this will balance out some of the general despair that many of us feel.</p>\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t<p>That Jewish writer, Ronald Feinman, is delusional to think that VP Pence could invoke the 25th Amendment in an attempt to remove &#8220;unhinged&#8221; President Trump without there being huge civil unrest, hopefully of a magnitude much greater than the daily protests by the basement dwelling totalitarian snowflakes on the Left.  Pence would have to nationalize the National Guard, and there is no guarantee that they will obey his orders.  Unless Trump resigns voluntarily, (highly unlikely IMO as he won&#8217;t go down in history as a quitter), there will be no overt attempt to dislodge him via a palace coup.  Impeachment seems unlikely.  He has committed no crime, but that&#8217;s not stopping the conspiracy theorists on the Left from working full-time to come up with something that might stick.   That leaves one other option, but are the people still dumb enough to buy into another lone gunman scenario?</p>\n",

      "<p>From the available literature, I conclude that kerosene therapy may be one of the best ways to eliminate pathogenic microbes and parasites from the blood and bowel. My article on pleomorphic microbes [2] shows that in all of the above-mentioned diseases there is an overgrowth of fungal and cell-wall deficient (CWD) pathogenic microbes in the blood. It appears that the success of kerosene is due to its detrimental effect on these fungi and CWD microbes, which then allows the immune system to eliminate remaining pockets of other pathogens and abnormal cells in tumours and affected organs.</p>\n",
      "<p>A comparison of several disinfectants found that kerosene, while not controlling the tested bacteria, had the strongest effect on suppressing Candida—stronger than even a sodium hypochlorite bleach [3]. This may actually be the secret of the healing success of kerosene: it suppresses Candida, viruses and CWD microbes while not harming normal gut bacteria.</p>\n",
      "<p>On a German forum I read about a case of intestinal Candida overgrowth that had been verified by microbial stool analysis. This had not been normalised after previous Candida treatment, but after the use of kerosene all the Candida-related problems disappeared, as did the allergic reactions to several foods. A follow-up stool analysis showed that the intestinal flora was in excellent condition.</p>\n",

      "<p>Robert Fletcher of the Militia of Montana, who ran for Congress in Florida in 1990, told the panel his organization had evidence that more than one bomb was used in Oklahoma City and that the FBI had identified &#8220;John Doe No. 2&#8221;-as a &#8220;person of foreign descent&#8221;-but would not make that revelation public.</p>\n",
      "<p>He insisted that the government is using sophisticated technology to conduct &#8220;weather wars,&#8221; noting the spate of Midwestern storms in recent years and saying that citizens eventually will be starved through such manipulation when the United Nations takes control of the United States.</p>\n",
      "<p>His Montana colleague, John Trochmann, told the senators, &#8220;We view the militia movement as a giant neighborhood watch.&#8221;</p>\n",
      "<p>&#8220;A nation can survive its fools and even the ambitious,&#8221; said Trochmann, &#8220;but it cannot survive treason from within.&#8221;</p>\n",
      "<p>Several senators asked the militia members for their view of the Oklahoma City bombing and of the public antipathy toward the federal government.</p>\n",
      "<p>All said they deplored the violence, with James Johnson, an African-American militia member from Ohio, maintaining that militia activity is the &#8220;civil rights movement of the &#8217;90s; it&#8217;s people drawing a line in the sand.&#8221;</p>\n",
      "<p>James L. Brown, deputy associate director of the ATF, told the panel that &#8220;the most recent propaganda circulating among some militia supporters is that (President Clinton) ordered the Oklahoma City bombing&#8221; as a predicate for cracking down on civilian militias.</p>\n",
      "<p>Militia witnesses were dismissive of law-enforcement allegations.</p>\n",
      "<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re trying to make us out to be something we&#8217;re not,&#8221; Olson said. &#8220;And we&#8217;re not what the press is trying to feed the American people, either.&#8221;</p>\n",
      "<p>But Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), testifying before the Judiciary subcommittee on terrorism, technology and government information, said law-enforcement officials in his state had evidence that police officers were &#8220;being stalked&#8221; by militia members.</p>\n",
      "<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need private armies to protect us from our own government,&#8221; Levin said.</p>\n",
      "<p>Another witness, Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), charged that the Militia of Montana &#8220;uses anti-Semitic code words like `shadow government&#8217; and `banking elite.&#8217; &#8221;</p>\n",
      "<p>More than a little of the testimony bordered on the bizarre, with Trochmann telling Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that she had a concealed-weapon permit, which she fiercely denied.</p>\n",
      "<p>&#8220;I apologize,&#8221; Trochmann said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to speak to my informants in California.&#8221;</p>\n",
      "<p>Olson said that the Japanese government had a role in the Oklahoma City bombing. He told Specter he disagreed with the senator&#8217;s belief in the &#8220;single-bullet&#8221; theory in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.</p>\n",
      "<p>Specter, who served as an investigator for the Warren Commission that investigated the assassination and was identified as the author of the theory in Oliver Stone&#8217;s movie &#8220;JFK,&#8221; waved off the criticism but later offered to share his views on the subject with Olson.</p>\n",
      "<p>Rep. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) criticized Specter for holding the hearings, calling them &#8220;a soap box for the wacky Right.&#8221;</p>\n",

      "<p>&#8220;To predicate an investigation under FBI guidelines, there must be good-faith suspicion that (a) a federal crime has been or is being committed, (b) there is a threat to American national security, or (c) there is an opportunity to collect foreign intelligence relevant to a priority established by the executive branch. These categories frequently overlap e.g., a terrorist will typically commit several crimes in a plot that threatens national security, and when captured he will be a source of foreign intelligence.&#8221;</p>\n",

      "<p>Trump is there because the enemy is AFRAID.  Their obnoxious tones show their fear.  I have a keen eye, and have always observed that when times are good and goy unaware, the enemy treads softly in the paranoid fear of discovery.  The screams, the taunts and the outright hate are all only seen when they are afraid.  We know.  Trump is there because the Witch Hillary would have started a War.  It would have been over quick.  No patriots fight for niggers to rape his daughters and wives.  This sick dessicated corpse cannot muster enough fight to save the whores in Washington.  Trump is a sign.  Things have changed.  They are AFRAID.  They are buying time, and trying to improvise.  They suck at this.  War is inevitable.  Pence cannot get by, and Trump cannot delay forever.  They should run, but they won&#8217;t.  They are too soft and lazy to run while the threat is not coming right now.  That&#8217;s the kind of stupid I love to see in enemies.</p>\n",
