MESA, AZ -- On Betty Lee’s most recent birthday, Mesa Fire and Medical Department Chief Mary Cameli, delivered a photograph to her friend of 20 years.

During that visit, Lee, 90, told Cameli a story that had inspired her. On a news report the night before, a lady had turned 100 years old, and had always wanted to ride in a police car. The community had rallied together to grant her that wish.

“So we asked her, in her 90s, what was something she had always wanted to do?” said Cameli. “And she said she’s always wanted to get to ride in the firetruck. And so we said, ‘That’s something we can do.’ ”

Lee’s late husband, Milt Lee, founded the Mesa Public Safety Foundation in 1976, and Betty worked as the secretary of that group. The foundation helped raise funds, and gave an annual breakfast recognizing first responders and citizens who had helped police or fire personnel in their jobs. Milt passed away in 2012.

“It was really a PR thing, to get the public and the citizens to know how wonderful our police and fire are,” said Lee.

“What we did was honor the police and fire each year, those who did heroic deeds, and we had a banquet to present them to the public so the public would be aware of what our police and fire department were doing,” said Wayne Pomeroy.

Pomeroy, 94, is a lifelong resident of Mesa and took over the Public Safety Foundation after two terms as mayor, ending in 1980. During his time in office, Pomeroy said, he helped implement the 911 system, and the paramedic program of the Mesa fire department.

And so, on a sunny afternoon Thursday, a nearly 34-foot firetruck rolled into a quiet neighborhood near the Mesa Country Club, and stopped at the end of a cul-de-sac in front of Pomeroy’s home.

Firefighters Jake Bennett, Sean Couden, engineer Dan Hammerl and Capt. Casey Russell helped the two nonagenarians down the driveway, and carefully lifted them into the truck. Mesa Councilman Mark Freeman and Pomeroy's daughter Michelle Pomeroy came along for the once-in-a-lifetime ride.

After securing the precious cargo, the crew of Mesa Fire Engine 201 fired up the lights, and took off for a twirl around the neighborhood.

“I’m glad that I was invited to come, because I really only did the secretarial part of it. It’s my husband that they’re really honoring,” said Lee.

“They’ve been supportive of us for many, many years, and this was just a small way that we can give back and say thank you for the many, many years of service that you have provided for public safety,” said Cameli.
